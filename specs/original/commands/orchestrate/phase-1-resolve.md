# /orchestrate — Phase 1: Resolve the Issue Set

## Phase 1: Resolve the Issue Set

### Batch-Start Timestamp (T0) — capture FIRST, before any resolution

<!-- Added: forge#2628 -->

Before parsing `$ARGUMENTS` or resolving anything, capture the batch's start timestamp once:

```bash
BATCH_T0=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
echo "Batch start T0: ${BATCH_T0}"
```

`BATCH_T0` is the anchor for the run-spawned-vs-backlog cascade distinction used throughout this
file's "Cascade / Review-Finding Resolution" section below and by `phase-4-execution.md` Step 4C.
Persist it alongside `ORIGINATING_QUERY_KIND`/`ORIGINATING_QUERY_PATTERN`/`ORIGINATING_QUERY_ARGS`
(see "Predicate Persistence" below) in the batch's in-memory/report state so Phase 4 reads the
same value this step captured — it must never independently re-derive its own T0 from "now" at
whatever later moment Step 4A.pre happens to run, which would silently widen the window past what
this run actually spawned. If a session resumes mid-run without `BATCH_T0` in context (e.g. after
compaction), Phase 4's Step 4A.pre falls back to capturing its own timestamp — see that section's
note — but this is a degraded fallback, not the normal path.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine which issues to work on:

### Input Patterns

| Input | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `milestone <slug>` | All open issues assigned to that GitHub milestone (default repo) |
| `#1 #2 #3` or `1 2 3` | Specific issue numbers, optionally repo-prefixed (e.g., `#123 mcp:5 n8n:12`) |
| `next <N>` | Top N priority open issues (P0 first, then P1, etc. — accepts both `priority:P<n>` and bare `P<n>` labels, see "Priority label schema" note under P3 batching below) |
| `next <N> all-repos` | Top N across ALL ecosystem repos |
| `fast-lane` or `fast` | All open fast-lane issues (no milestone, bugs/fixes) |
| `priority:P0` or `priority:P1` | All open issues with that priority label (matches both `priority:P<n>` and bare `P<n>` on the target repo — see "Priority label schema" note below) |
| `mcp:fast` or `n8n:next 3` | Repo-scoped queries |
| `cascade`, `review-findings`, or `findings` (optionally `--include-deferred` / `--allow-gen2` / `--include-backlog`) | `review-finding` issues created at/after this batch's T0 (default repo, or repo-scoped e.g. `mcp:cascade`) — i.e. empty unless combined with a run that has already spawned findings, or `--include-backlog` is passed. See "Cascade / Review-Finding Resolution" below for the run-spawned-vs-backlog distinction and the generation-depth admission on top of it (`orchestration.cascade.max_generation`, default 1). <!-- Added: forge#2231, forge#2234, forge#2628 -->|
| `<slug>` (no keyword) | Try milestone first, then fall back to label search. If both resolve to zero issues, report near-miss label candidates instead of silently resolving to nothing — see "Near-Miss Suggestion" below. <!-- Added: forge#2231 -->|

### Cascade / Review-Finding Resolution

<!-- Added: forge#2231, T0-scoping added: forge#2628 -->

When the input matches `cascade`, `review-findings`, or `findings` (case-insensitive, optionally repo-prefixed), resolve to open `review-finding`-labeled issues instead of a milestone or plain label search, then apply a generation depth check so the default set here matches what Step 4C would actually admit.

**Two modes — run-spawned cascade (default) vs. whole-backlog sweep (explicit opt-in only):**

There are two different things an operator can mean by "cascade," and this resolve step must not
silently conflate them:

- **(a) Run-spawned cascade (default)** — recursively work the `review-finding` issues *this batch*
  produces. Bounded to findings created at/after `BATCH_T0` (captured at the very top of this file,
  before any resolution runs). This is the safe default: combined with an ordinary scoped batch
  (e.g. `<no:milestone set>` + `cascade`), it expresses "follow through on what this run's own
  `/review-pr` agents find" — not "also adopt every other open finding already sitting in the repo."
  Because `BATCH_T0` is captured at batch start, a bare `cascade` invocation with nothing yet spawned
  legitimately resolves to an **empty set** at Phase 1 — new findings admitted by this mode are picked
  up as they're created via `phase-4-execution.md` Step 4C's mid-run sweep (which uses the same
  `BATCH_T0` anchor), not via this one-shot Phase 1 fetch.
- **(b) Whole-backlog sweep (explicit opt-in only)** — work every open `review-finding` in the repo,
  regardless of when it was created. This is what the pre-#2628 default silently did on every
  `cascade`/`review-findings`/`findings` invocation. It is still available, but now requires the
  explicit `--include-backlog` flag (e.g. `cascade --include-backlog`, `review-findings
  --include-backlog`) — adding `cascade` to an already-scoped batch never implies it.

```bash
# BATCH_T0 was captured at the top of this file (Phase 1, "Batch-Start Timestamp (T0)"),
# before any resolution ran — reuse it here, do not recapture.

# --include-backlog opts into mode (b): the full open review-finding backlog, no created-date
# filter. Without it (the default, mode (a)), only findings created at/after BATCH_T0 are fetched
# — i.e. issues this batch itself could plausibly have spawned so far.
if echo "{ARGUMENTS}" | grep -qE -- '--include-backlog'; then
  CASCADE_MODE="backlog-sweep"
  CASCADE_SEARCH="label:review-finding"
else

  CASCADE_SEARCH="label:review-finding created:>=${BATCH_T0}"
fi
echo "Cascade mode: ${CASCADE_MODE} (search: \"${CASCADE_SEARCH}\")"

# Fetch matching open review-finding issues, including body (needed for the generation check
# below — unlike a plain label search, we cannot skip straight to {number,title,labels,milestone}
# here). --search (not --label) is required to combine the label filter with the created-date
# filter — verified working: `gh issue list --state open --search "label:review-finding
# created:>=$T0"`.

```

**Two independent filters apply, in sequence**: first the T0-vs-backlog *time* filter (`CASCADE_SEARCH` above — which issues are even fetched), then the generation *depth* filter below (which of the fetched issues are admitted). They answer different questions — "how far back in time" vs. "how many cascade hops deep" — and either can be widened independently of the other.

**Generation > `max_generation` findings are excluded by default** by the loop above — a `review-finding` issue whose *source* chain is deeper than `orchestration.cascade.max_generation` (default: 1, i.e. generation ≥ 2 excluded — the pre-#2234 behavior, unchanged when the section is absent) is normally deferred by Step 4C's autonomous check. The only automated exception is bounded P3 aggregation: a generation-2 P3 may become part of one auditable batch under `batch_max_generation`; it is never individually re-dispatched. That cap is an **autonomy guard**, not a human-request guard: it exists to stop an unattended run from cascading forever, not to block an operator who explicitly asked for this exact bucket of work. See `phase-4-execution.md` Step 4C rule 1 and the reworded anti-pattern note for the full rationale.

This resolve step is a human-requested entry point (the operator typed `cascade`/`review-findings`/`findings` directly), so it honors explicit overrides for both filters:

- `--include-backlog` (forge#2628): widens the **time** filter — mode (b) above, whole open backlog regardless of `BATCH_T0`. Independent of the generation-depth flags below; combine both to get "everything, at every depth" (e.g. `cascade --include-backlog --allow-gen2`).
- `--include-deferred` or `--allow-gen2` appended to the input (e.g. `cascade --allow-gen2`, `review-findings --include-deferred`): widens the **depth** filter — forces `MAX_GENERATION="unlimited"` above, admitting every generation into the resolved set for this run. Without either flag, `orchestration.cascade.max_generation` (default 1) governs how deep the resolved set reaches — the flags/config only change what this **explicit** request is allowed to touch; they do not relax Step 4C's autonomous behavior for anything spawned *during* this run (see "Recursion safety" below).
- **`orchestration.cascade.max_generation`** (forge#2234) is the config-driven successor to the CLI depth flags above and supports a granularity the flags cannot: `max_generation: 3` admits generations 1-3 and stops at 4, expressing "admit gen-2, stop at gen-3" directly — something an all-or-nothing `--allow-gen2` flag could never say. The flags remain available and, when passed, override config with `unlimited` for that one invocation. There is no equivalent config-driven lever for the time filter — `--include-backlog` is the only way to widen it, deliberately, since a config default that silently re-adopts the whole backlog would reintroduce exactly the bug this section fixes.

**Recursion safety (unchanged)**: findings spawned *during* this run by its own sweep agents are still never re-swept, regardless of whether `--include-backlog`/`--include-deferred`/`--allow-gen2`/`orchestration.cascade.max_generation` was in effect at resolve time — see `phase-4-execution.md` Step 4C rules and the recursion-safety note near the anti-patterns list. The overrides above only widen what this one resolve step admits from the *pre-existing* open issue set; they have no effect on Step 4C's in-run admission logic.

### Near-Miss Suggestion

<!-- Added: forge#2231 -->

When a bare `<slug>` (no keyword) resolves to **zero** issues via both the milestone lookup and the label-search fallback, do not silently return an empty set. Fetch the repo's label list and suggest the closest matching label(s) instead:

```bash
ALL_LABELS=$(gh label list {GH_FLAG} --json name --jq '.[].name')
# Simple substring/prefix match against the attempted slug — no fuzzy-matching library required.
NEAR_MISS=$(echo "$ALL_LABELS" | grep -iE "${SLUG:0:4}" || true)
```

Report back to the caller: `No milestone or label matched "{SLUG}". Did you mean: {NEAR_MISS list, or "review-finding"/"batch" if SLUG resembles "cascade"}?` This directly fixes the case reported in #2231 — `cascade` is not itself a label in most repos (the only cascade-adjacent labels are `review-finding` and `batch`), so a bare `cascade` slug previously resolved to nothing with no feedback. Note that `cascade`/`review-findings`/`findings` are now handled by the dedicated resolution rule above and never reach this bare-slug fallback path at all — this near-miss path remains for any other unmatched slug.

### Predicate Persistence (literal set vs. standing query)

<!-- Added: forge#2236 -->

Phase 1 resolves `$ARGUMENTS` to a concrete issue-number list exactly once, at T0, and that list is currently frozen for the rest of the run (`phase-4-execution.md`: "Phase 1 only runs once, at the start."). Of the input patterns above, only `#1 #2 #3` / `1 2 3` (optionally repo-prefixed) is genuinely a one-time literal set — every other row (`milestone <slug>`, `next <N>`, `next <N> all-repos`, `fast-lane`, `priority:P0`/`priority:P1`, `mcp:fast`/`n8n:next 3`, a bare `<slug>`) is a **standing query**: the predicate ("all open P0s", "this milestone") is the caller's actual intent, not the specific numbers it happened to resolve to at T0.

Classify `$ARGUMENTS` and persist that classification alongside the resolved issue-number list, so Phase 4 (`phase-4-execution.md` Step 4B) can decide whether to re-run the query later in the batch:

```bash
node -e '
import("{REPO_PATH}/bin/engine/resolve.mjs").then(({ classifyInputPattern }) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(classifyInputPattern(process.argv[1])));
}, () => process.exit(0));
' "$ARGUMENTS"
```

This mirrors `bin/engine/resolve.mjs`'s `classifyInputPattern` — a typed, unit-tested reference implementation of the same literal-vs-query rule table shown here (see that file's docstring). As with `admission.mjs` for cascade policy, the two must stay in sync by hand: any change to which patterns count as `literal` vs `query` in this table must be mirrored in `resolve.mjs`, and vice versa.

Persist the result (`kind`, `pattern`, `args`) next to the resolved issue-number list in the batch's in-memory/report state — e.g. `ORIGINATING_QUERY_KIND`, `ORIGINATING_QUERY_PATTERN`, `ORIGINATING_QUERY_ARGS`. Phase 4's re-resolution step (see `phase-4-execution.md` Step 4B) reads these three values; it never re-derives them from `$ARGUMENTS` a second time. If `kind` is `literal`, Phase 4 MUST NOT attempt to re-resolve — the list of numbers already resolved here IS the complete intent.

**`BATCH_T0` is persisted the same way** (forge#2628) — alongside these three values, not as a separate mechanism. Phase 4's Step 4A.pre reads the persisted `BATCH_T0` for Step 4C's run-spawned-cascade time filter (see that section); it must not capture a fresh "now" of its own, which would silently widen the admitted window past what this run actually spawned between Phase 1 and Phase 4's start.

### Fetch the issues

For each resolved repo, use the appropriate `-R` flag:

```bash
# Default repo (no flag needed if using GH_FLAG="" for the default):
gh issue list {GH_FLAG} --milestone "{TITLE}" --state open --limit 500 --json number,title,labels,milestone --jq '.[] | {number, title, labels: [.labels[].name], milestone: .milestone.title}'

# Satellite repos — always include -R flag with the satellite repo from forge.yaml:
# For each satellite in forge.yaml → repos.satellites:
gh issue list -R {SATELLITE_REPO} --milestone "{TITLE}" --state open --limit 500 --json number,title,labels,milestone

# For specific numbers with repo prefix:
gh issue view {NUMBER} -R {SATELLITE_REPO} --json number,title,labels,state,milestone,body

# For "all-repos" — fetch from all configured repos and combine:
gh issue list {GH_FLAG} --state open --limit {N} --json number,title,labels,milestone
# For each satellite in forge.yaml → repos.satellites:
gh issue list -R {SATELLITE_REPO} --state open --limit 500 --json number,title,labels,milestone
# Combine, sort by priority, take top N.
# Priority rank when sorting: read each issue's labels and normalize to bare P<n> form —
# `priority:P<n>` and bare `P<n>` both resolve to the same rank (see "Priority label schema"
# note under P3 batching below); an issue with neither label form sorts last, not first, and
# should be logged as untriaged rather than silently treated as top priority. <!-- Added: forge#2232 -->
```

**Count validation**: After fetching issues, log the count returned. If a milestone query returns exactly 30 issues, warn the user: "WARNING: Exactly 30 issues returned — gh CLI default may have truncated results. Re-running with --limit 500 is recommended." (The --limit 500 above prevents this for standard runs, but verify if the count seems suspiciously low relative to milestone expectations.)

**Tag each issue with its project prefix** in your internal tracking so sub-agents receive the correct repo context.

### Filter out ineligible issues

Remove issues that should NOT be worked on:
- Already closed or has `workflow:merged` label
- Has `workflow:invalid` label
- Has `needs-human` label (requires manual action)
- Has `workflow:decomposed` label (parent tracker — its sub-issues should be picked up instead)
- Has `workflow:building` or `workflow:in-review` label (already in progress)
- Is an epic (`epic` label) — these are planning containers, not buildable

If a `workflow:decomposed` issue is found, automatically expand it to its open sub-issues instead.

### Source-PR Triage Hint (pre-flight, non-binding)

<!-- Added: forge#2351 -->

**This is a triage hint for the operator and the dispatched investigation agent — it is NEVER an automated verdict.** It must never cause an issue to be closed, skipped, or excluded from dispatch. See "CRITICAL: No duplicate detection at orchestrator level" below — that rule's spirit ("only a `/work-on` investigation agent, after reading the actual code, can determine validity") applies identically here: a closed-unmerged source PR is a reason to look closer, not a reason to skip looking at all.

**Why this exists**: `staging-review`/`review-finding` issues carry a `**Source**: PR #{N}` citation in their body (e.g. `**Source**: PR #2337 — Deploy: staging → main`, or `**Source**: PR #2337 | Agent: material-change | Confidence: ... | Severity: ...` — see `review-pr-staging.md` and `review-pr.md` for the citation format). When that source PR closed without merging, the finding's premise ("this change lands on staging/main") may or may not still hold — resolving the PR's state ONCE per distinct PR number, before dispatch, costs one `gh pr view` call and gives the operator and the investigation agent a head start, without ever deciding the outcome.

**Two counterexamples from the same 2026-07-17 run prove why this must stay a hint, never a skip:**
- **#2339 / #2342** — source PR #2337 closed unmerged; the flagged change genuinely never landed by any route (`git log -S` found zero commits for #2339's flagged line; the widening commit in #2342 is not an ancestor of `origin/main`). The hint would have been correct here.
- **#2346 / #2261 (the load-bearing counterexample)** — source PR #2337 also closed unmerged for #2346, but the flagged code reached `staging` anyway via a **different, independently-merged PR (#2261, commit `90376f5`)** — verified via `git merge-base --is-ancestor 90376f5 origin/staging`. #2346 correctly ended at `needs-human`, not `invalid`. A hint that had been treated as a verdict ("source PR never merged → close") would have been **factually wrong** here — sibling PRs can and do reintroduce or independently land the same code by a different route. **The rule to encode: "the source PR never merged" does NOT imply "the finding is moot."**

**Resolve once per distinct PR number, not once per issue** (many findings from one staging review cite the same source PR):

```bash
# Fetch staging-review / review-finding issues from the already-resolved issue set.
# Follows this file's per-issue `gh issue view` convention (see Step 3A/3B in
# phase-3-dependency.md) rather than assuming a pre-materialized bulk JSON variable.
declare -A SOURCE_PR_STATE_CACHE   # PR number -> "state|mergedAt" (cached, resolved once per PR)
declare -A ISSUE_SOURCE_PR         # issue number -> cited PR number (or empty if no citation found)
declare -A ISSUE_SOURCE_PR_STATE   # issue number -> "OPEN" | "MERGED" | "CLOSED_UNMERGED" | "unknown"

    ISSUE_LIKELY_MOOT[$NUM]="unknown"
  else
    ISSUE_SOURCE_PR_STATE[$NUM]="OPEN"
    ISSUE_LIKELY_MOOT[$NUM]="unknown"
  fi
done
```

**Output arrays** (consumed downstream — never re-derived): `ISSUE_LIKELY_MOOT[$NUM]` (`yes`/`unknown`), `ISSUE_SOURCE_PR[$NUM]` (cited PR number or empty), `ISSUE_SOURCE_PR_STATE[$NUM]` (`OPEN`/`MERGED`/`CLOSED_UNMERGED`/`unknown`).

- `commands/orchestrate/phase-3-dependency.md` Step 3E's Dependency Graph plan table dereferences `ISSUE_LIKELY_MOOT[$NUM]` as a `Source-PR Hint` column — informational only, never affecting a row's `Status`.
- `commands/orchestrate/phase-4-execution.md`'s Agent-spawn template threads `ISSUE_LIKELY_MOOT[$NUM]` / `ISSUE_SOURCE_PR[$NUM]` / `ISSUE_SOURCE_PR_STATE[$NUM]` into the dispatched agent's initial context as `{SOURCE_PR_HINT_CONTEXT}`, explicitly framed as a starting point to check first — never as a reason to skip investigating.

**MUST NOT**: This hint MUST NOT be used, anywhere in this pipeline, to auto-close an issue, auto-skip it from dispatch, exclude it from the resolved issue set, or substitute for the investigation agent's own evidence-based verdict. Every `likely-moot: yes` issue is still dispatched into a full `/work-on` pipeline exactly like every other issue in the resolved set — the "CRITICAL: No duplicate detection at orchestrator level" rule below governs this identically.

### Review-Finding Batching (deterministic grouping rule)

<!-- Added: forge#1333 -->
<!-- Extended: forge#1818 — default-batchable eligibility, surface-area grouping, lowered same-file threshold -->
<!-- Extended: forge#2232 — priority-label schema tolerance (bare P<n> vs priority:P<n>) -->

Before finalizing the issue set, apply the shared batching rule to reduce full-pipeline overhead on routine review findings.

**Single implementation (MANDATORY):** `bin/engine/admission.mjs` owns the eligibility, same-file, leaf-directory, age, eight-member, open-batch-extension, and singleton-reason rules through `planP3Batches()`. Every admission point supplies its complete current candidate registry plus parsed open batch metadata to that function, then executes only its returned `create`/`extend` actions. Do not independently reproduce thresholds or eligibility predicates in this file. The legacy shell examples below describe GitHub data collection and action execution only; their grouping decisions must be replaced by the evaluator result. Include original resolved issues, prior-cycle singletons, cascade findings, predicate re-resolution matches, and completion-sweep candidates in the registry. <!-- Added: forge#2851 -->

After executing the plan, retain every singleton in the registry for the next admission event and record `summarizeP3BatchPlan()` in the per-run batching summary: clusters formed, members absorbed, open batches extended, and ungrouped members with their reasons.

```bash
# BATCH_CANDIDATE_REGISTRY_JSON contains every candidate accumulated so far, with
# a stable `id` (`{repo}:{number}`), repo, title, problem/body, labels, affectedFile,
# createdAt, and isBatch. OPEN_BATCHES_JSON contains existing batch issue metadata.
# Run this after initial resolution and every later admission event; execute returned
# actions using memberIds, never bare issue numbers, so satellite issues cannot collide.
BATCH_PLAN=$(node -e '
  import("{REPO_PATH}/bin/engine/admission.mjs").then(({ planP3Batches, summarizeP3BatchPlan }) => {
    const plan = planP3Batches({ candidates: JSON.parse(process.argv[1]), openBatches: JSON.parse(process.argv[2]) });
    console.log(JSON.stringify({ plan, summary: summarizeP3BatchPlan(plan) }));
  });
' "$BATCH_CANDIDATE_REGISTRY_JSON" "$OPEN_BATCHES_JSON")
```

**Priority label schema**: ForgeDock's own issue creator (`review-pr.md`) writes only the canonical `priority:P<n>` label form. Some repos this pipeline operates against (issues opened externally, imported, or predating ForgeDock adoption) instead carry a bare `P<n>` label with no `priority:` prefix. Every priority-read check in this section — and its mirrors in `phase-4-execution.md` and `cleanup.md` — MUST accept both forms. `priority:P<n>` wins when (unusually) both are present on the same issue. Issue-*creation* call sites (the batch-issue creation below) are unaffected and keep writing canonical `priority:P<n>` only — there is no case where this pipeline needs to *write* the bare form. <!-- Added: forge#2232 -->

**Trigger conditions** (default-batchable — no opt-in marker required):
1. The issue has label `review-finding` + a P3 priority label (`priority:P3` or bare `P3`)
2. The issue does NOT match any Safety exclusion below

The `<!-- FORGE:BATCHABLE -->` marker (still appended by `review-pr.md` at finding-creation time) is honored when present but is no longer REQUIRED for eligibility — a `review-finding`+`priority:P3` issue is batchable by default unless explicitly excluded. This closes the gap where cascade-spawned findings that never carried the marker sat un-batched indefinitely. <!-- Added: forge#1818 -->

**Safety classification:** P0/P1 findings stay individual because batching adds urgent-work latency. P2 is an ordering signal, not a batching veto. Billing is never batched, and path-owned danger zones, migrations, high-fan-in entrypoints, compose files, and `.env.example` are excluded by `batchExclusionReason()` in `bin/engine/admission.mjs`. The default path map excludes `infra/migrations/*credit_balance*` and `services/api/app/billing/**` regardless of wording. Security-relevant findings may batch only with members of the same coarse class, capped at **3** members. Every exclusion must log its `urgency`, `domain`, or `high-blast-radius` predicate.
- Issue has a `needs-human`, `blocked`, or `operator-only` label, or explicitly states `operator-only`, `manual action required`, or `human action required` in its title or `## Problem` section

Use `bin/engine/admission.mjs`'s `classifyBatchSafety()` as the reference classifier in every mirror. It recognizes `inject`, `injection`, `xss`, `csrf`, `ssrf`, `bypass`, `escalat`, `credential`, `secret`, `token`, `password`, `pgpassword`, `htpasswd`, `redact`, `sanitiz`, `scheme`, `traversal`, `deserializ`, `rce`, and `privilege`, as well as security/anti-bot and auth. Auth matches compound identifiers (`MaintenanceAuth`, `AdminAuth`, `authz_check`) but not `authority_source`; exact `**Agent**:` attribution lines are stripped before classification. A `FORGE:CLASS` slug takes precedence when present, otherwise use this coarse class. <!-- Changed: forge#2859 -->

**Grouping algorithm (surface area — same file first, leaf directory as broader fallback):** <!-- Changed: forge#1818 — was domain-only -->
```bash
# Fetch all open batchable P3 issues (default-batchable; marker no longer required).
# NOTE: `--label` is an exact-match GH filter and cannot OR "priority:P3" with bare "P3" in
# one query, so the P3 test moves into the jq predicate below (schema-tolerant, forge#2232).
# Only "review-finding" stays in the --label filter.
# Billing remains the sole absolute exclusion. Security findings stay in the
# candidate set so they can be grouped by their same `FORGE:CLASS`/coarse class.
# Word-boundary anchored so it matches whole terms only, not substrings:
# `authority_source`/`authoritative`/`author`/`authored` no longer trip `auth`.
# `authentication|authorization|authn|authz` are listed explicitly so real
# auth-domain findings that never use the bare word "auth" still exclude.

```

**Batch creation rule (ordered grouping keys):** <!-- Changed: forge#1818 — added lower same-file tier -->
- **Same-file cluster** (primary, low threshold): When **2+** batchable P3 issues share the exact same affected file, create a batch issue for that file cluster. Same-file P3 findings are the dominant low-value token sink (dead imports, stale comments, style nits) and already conflict with each other if built individually — the low threshold reflects that they'd otherwise serialize into slow one-at-a-time chains regardless of count.
- **Source-PR cohort**: When **2+** remaining findings cite the same `**Source**: PR #N`, create a batch regardless of their affected paths. The source citation is parsed mechanically; a source PR that closed unmerged remains eligible.
- **Defect-class cluster**: When **2+** remaining findings have the same `<!-- FORGE:CLASS: <slug> -->` annotation, create a batch. This is opt-in and uses only the emitted machine-readable slug; do not infer a class from prose.
- **Leaf-directory cluster** (broader fallback): When **3+** remaining batchable P3 issues share the same leaf directory but are not already claimed, OR the oldest batchable P3 in that leaf directory exceeds 72 hours, create a batch issue for that leaf-directory cluster.
- Form groups in this order: same-file, source-PR, defect-class, leaf-directory. A finding is claimed by at most one batch.

**Reference implementation and periodic sweep (MANDATORY):** `bin/engine/admission.mjs` exports `planP3BatchGroups()` and `batchExclusionReason()`, the deterministic reference for eligibility, the four ordered keys, the 3-member leaf threshold, and the eight-member cap. Every pass supplies the complete retained candidate registry plus open batches; execute `extensions` before creating new groups, retain `ungrouped` findings, and log each selected group kind or exclusion predicate. Run it at initial resolution and again after every five completions or whenever the deferred queue reaches the concurrency cap. <!-- Added: forge#2858; extended: forge#2851, forge#2852 -->

**Generation-cap exception (sanctioned, bounded, and auditable):** P3 batching may aggregate a
deferred generation-2 finding without `--allow-gen2`: aggregation replaces several low-priority
pipelines with one reviewed unit and is therefore a bounded alternative to recursively dispatching
each finding. It is not an implicit unlimited override. Before forming each cluster, use
`compute_generation` above for every member, retain only members at or below the finite
`orchestration.cascade.batch_max_generation` ceiling (default `2`), and leave higher-generation
members deferred. Record the maximum retained member generation as `{BATCH_MAX_GENERATION}` and
list every retained generation-2-or-higher member in the batch body. This makes the exception
visible to operators and ensures a generation-6 finding cannot become dispatchable merely by being
grouped. `policy: all` does not remove this batching ceiling. <!-- Added: forge#2849 -->

**Sanitize the surface-area path before interpolation (MANDATORY):** `{SURFACE_AREA}` is an affected-file path derived from an issue body, and git filenames can legally carry shell metacharacters (`` ` ``, `$()`, quotes). Restrict it to a validated `[A-Za-z0-9._/-]` charset before templating it into `--title` / `--body`, so an untrusted issue body cannot break the `gh` argument boundary. The same guard is applied at the mirror site in `phase-4-execution.md`. <!-- forge#1833, forge#1835 -->

**Route batch issue creation through `/issue`'s programmatic invocation contract** (`commands/issue.md`, added #2085) instead of calling `gh issue create` directly — this gets dedup (Phase 2D) and mandatory-section body validation (Phase 3F) for free. <!-- Changed: forge#2086 — route through /issue create-hook -->

**Exclude the cluster's own member issues from the dedup candidate set (MANDATORY):** A batch title necessarily restates its member findings' subject matter by construction — it is a deliberate supersede, not an accidental duplicate — so without exclusion it always collides with its own members under Phase 2D's token-overlap algorithm, making the batching rule unfollowable. Pass the cluster's member issue numbers via `/issue`'s `--exclude` flag (`scripts/issue-dedup.sh --exclude`, forge#2432) so Phase 2D only fires on a **genuine non-member duplicate** — some other open issue this batch was never meant to cover. This is NOT a `--force` equivalent: it narrows the candidate set, it does not disable the gate. <!-- Added: forge#2432 -->

```bash
SAFE_SURFACE_AREA=$(printf '%s' "{SURFACE_AREA}" | tr -cd 'A-Za-z0-9._/-')
MEMBER_LIST="{N1},{N2},{N3},..."  # comma-joined member issue numbers for this cluster (e.g. "2422,2424")
SCRATCHPAD="${FORGE_SCRATCHPAD:-$PWD/.forge-scratch}"
AGENT_TOKEN="${AGENT_ID:-${HOSTNAME:-orchestrator}-$$}"
mkdir -p "$SCRATCHPAD"

## Problem

Batch of P3 review findings in **{SURFACE_AREA}** (same file or leaf directory), grouped to reduce per-finding pipeline overhead.

## Root Cause

Unverified grouped finding hypotheses. Investigation must validate each member and determine whether one shared cause exists.

## Affected Files

Candidate investigation starting points (not mutation authority):
1. `{SURFACE_AREA}` — inspect the common file or leaf-directory evidence cited by members.

## Expected Behavior

Validated member findings are resolved or closed as false positives without unrelated scope growth or regression.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All member findings validated and addressed or closed as false-positive.
- [ ] Member issues auto-closed with reference to the batch PR on merge.
- [ ] No security, billing, anti-bot, or auth paths touched unless separately investigated and claimed.

## Member Findings

<!-- FORGE:BATCH_MEMBERS -->
{for each member issue: "- [ ] #{NUM}: {TITLE}"}
{for security-class members only: "  - **Verdict**: [ ] live vector  [ ] defence-in-depth"}
<!-- /FORGE:BATCH_MEMBERS -->

**Maximum member generation**: {BATCH_MAX_GENERATION}
<!-- FORGE:BATCH_MAX_GENERATION: {BATCH_MAX_GENERATION} --> <!-- allowlist:check-spec-markers -->

**Generation >= 2 members admitted by bounded batching**: {#{NUM} (generation N), or "none"}

## Context

**Batch policy**: 2+ same file, 2+ same source PR cohort, 2+ same explicit defect class, or 3+ same leaf directory (or oldest > 72h).
**Member issues**: #{N1}, #{N2}, #{N3}, ...

<!-- FORGE:BATCHABLE -->
BATCH_EOF
printf '\n<!-- %s -->\n' "$BATCH_BODY_MARKER" >> "$BATCH_BODY_FILE"
```

```
ISSUE_SKILL_OUTPUT=$(Skill(skill="issue", args="--title \"fix(batch): P3 review findings — ${SAFE_SURFACE_AREA} (batch #{BATCH_N})\" --body-file \"${BATCH_BODY_FILE}\" --label \"review-finding\" --label \"priority:P3\" --label \"batch\" --exclude \"${MEMBER_LIST}\""))
```

**Consume `/issue`'s explicit result contract** (see `commands/issue.md` Phases 2D and 4C). A dedup STOP is an expected, named outcome; any output without either result marker is a hard create failure:

```bash
BATCH_ISSUE_NUM=$(printf '%s\n' "$ISSUE_SKILL_OUTPUT" | sed -n 's/.*ISSUE_CREATE_RESULT:CREATED number=\([0-9][0-9]*\).*/\1/p' | head -1)
DEDUP_NUMBER=$(printf '%s\n' "$ISSUE_SKILL_OUTPUT" | sed -n 's/.*ISSUE_CREATE_RESULT:DEDUP number=\([0-9][0-9]*\).*/\1/p' | head -1)

if [ -n "$DEDUP_NUMBER" ]; then
  echo "Batch dedup STOP: existing non-member issue #${DEDUP_NUMBER}; members remain on the standard individual pipeline."
elif [ -z "$BATCH_ISSUE_NUM" ]; then
  # Neither verified creation nor explicit dedup was reported. Do not replace
  # member issues. <!-- forge#2842 -->
  echo "ERROR: /issue did not report a verified batch issue number. This is a create failure (including a swallowed GitHub secondary-rate-limit response), not a dedup STOP. Do not replace member issues; stop this batch and retry after resolving the GitHub failure." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

**Replace member issues with the batch issue** in the resolved issue set. Member issues are NOT individually dispatched to `/work-on` — the batch issue is the single pipeline unit.

**Important limits**:
- Routine batches have at most **8** members. Security-class batches have at most **3** members and never mix classes.
- P1 and P2 issues are NEVER batched — they keep the standard one-issue-one-PR path
- Billing is NEVER batched; security P3 findings follow the same-class, three-member rule above.
- Human-gated findings are NEVER batched: `needs-human`, `blocked`, `operator-only`, and explicit operator-action requests remain independently tracked
- Batch issues themselves are never nested inside other batch issues

If no grouping key reaches its threshold and no leaf-directory candidate exceeds 72h, skip batch creation entirely — individual P3s run through the standard pipeline.

### CRITICAL: No duplicate detection at orchestrator level

**The orchestrator NEVER closes, merges, or deduplicates issues.** Even if two issues look like duplicates (similar titles, same error message, same symptoms), they may target different code paths, different ORM objects, or different failure modes. Only a `/work-on` investigation agent — after reading the actual code — can determine whether an issue is truly a duplicate.

**What the orchestrator must NOT do:**
- Close an issue as "duplicate" based on title/symptom similarity
- Skip an issue because another issue "covers it"
- Merge two issues into one agent
- Make ANY judgment about issue validity

**What the orchestrator SHOULD do:**
- If two issues look related, add a note in the agent prompt: "Note: #{OTHER} has similar symptoms — investigate whether this is the same root cause or a different code path"
- Let both agents run independently — if one finds it's truly a duplicate, `/work-on`'s investigation phase will close it as invalid with evidence
- Flag potential overlap in the DAG plan for the user's awareness, but NEVER act on it

**Why**: Surface-level similarity hides critical differences. #3842 (api_key.id lazy load) and #4039 (user.id lazy load) had identical error messages but targeted completely different ORM objects. Closing #4039 as a "duplicate" would have left a customer-impacting P0 bug unfixed.
