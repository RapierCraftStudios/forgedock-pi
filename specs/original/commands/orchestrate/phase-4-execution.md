# /orchestrate — Phase 4: Streaming DAG Execution

## Phase 4: Streaming DAG Execution

**Entry requires `phase-3-dependency.md`'s Step 3D.6 completion gate to have passed.** <!-- Added: forge#1913 --> Every step below (budget init, dispatch, dependency resolution) reads `ISSUES[]`, `PREDECESSORS[]`, `ISSUE_DOMAIN[]`, `ISSUE_SCORE[]`, `ISSUE_COST_ESTIMATE[]`, and `ISSUE_HAS_PRIOR[]` as authoritative Phase 3 output — none of these are re-derived here. If Phase 4 is being entered without having actually run Phase 3's Steps 3A–3E.5 in this session (e.g. a fresh session resuming mid-batch), reconstruct from GitHub via the "Orchestrator state reconstruction on wake / after compaction" procedure in `phase-3-dependency.md` rather than assuming these variables are already populated.

### Step 4A-pre.-1: Lease gate (MANDATORY, before any dispatch) <!-- Added: forge#2627 -->

**WHY THIS EXISTS**: Nothing today checks whether another live `/orchestrate` instance already holds this batch before dispatching (see issue #2627). Two concurrent loops (a stale survivor plus a restart, or two independent invocations) then both re-derive a ready set from GitHub and both dispatch — duplicate/backlog dispatch, and a restarted instance's own bookkeeping can diverge from what the first loop already did. This step closes that gap at the single entry point every dispatch group (initial ready set + every subsequent newly-unblocked batch) passes through, by extending the Step 3D.1 coordination issue into a single-instance lease (see `phase-3-dependency.md` Step 3D.2 for `check_orchestrator_lease()` and the `FORGE:LEASE`/`FORGE:LEASE_RELEASED` comment format).

**Run this once, before the first dispatch of any group in this session** — not per-chunk, per-issue, or per-newly-ready-batch.

```bash
# --- Lease gate (uses check_orchestrator_lease() from phase-3-dependency.md Step 3D.2;
#     re-declare it here if this context hasn't sourced that file) ---
if [ -n "${FORGE_COORD_ISSUE:-}" ] && [ -n "${COORD_ISSUE_NUMBER:-}" ] && [ -n "${BATCH_ID:-}" ]; then

      ;;
  esac
else
  echo "INFO: no coordination issue / BATCH_ID available — lease enforcement disabled for this batch."
fi
# --- End lease gate ---
```

**Lease release**: `LEASE_RELEASED_THIS_SESSION` (declared just below, alongside `release_orchestrator_lease()`) guards against double-posting `FORGE:LEASE_RELEASED`. The release call is invoked from both the **Step 4A-pre.-0.5 "Stopping the orchestrator"** procedure (interrupted path) and the **Termination condition** at the end of Step 4B (normal clean/paused drain) — both exit paths route through the same idempotent function so the lease is never left dangling either way.

```bash
LEASE_RELEASED_THIS_SESSION=false

release_orchestrator_lease() {
  # Idempotent — safe to call from both the interrupted-stop procedure and normal
  # end-of-batch completion without double-posting FORGE:LEASE_RELEASED.

  fi
  LEASE_RELEASED_THIS_SESSION=true
}
```

### Step 4A-pre.-0.5: Backgrounded engine-child tracking + interruption handling ("Stopping the orchestrator") (MANDATORY) <!-- Added: forge#2627 -->

**WHY THIS EXISTS**: Step 4A's engine-first dispatch (fixed by forge#2466) already dispatches each `forgedock run-issue` invocation as its own `Bash(run_in_background=true, ...)` call and records the returned task id in `ENGINE_DISPATCH_MAP[{NUM}]` — this is a harness-managed background task, not a raw shell `&` job. **Because it is harness-managed, it cannot be reaped by a shell-level `trap`/`kill $PID`**: a bash `trap` only runs inside that one Bash tool invocation's own process and has no way to call back into the harness's own task-management surface (`TaskStop`). Reaping these tasks on interrupt is therefore something the orchestrating agent itself must do — as an explicit step in its own routing loop — not something a background shell script can do on its own behalf.

**Contract — the orchestrating agent (not a shell trap) is responsible for reaping**: Whenever the interactive `/orchestrate` session is being stopped (the operator sends an interrupt, or the harness delivers a stop signal to the top-level orchestrator agent) **before** all dispatched issues have reached a terminal `workflow:*` label, the orchestrator MUST, as part of handling that stop — not silently exit —:

1. Enumerate every task id still tracked in `ENGINE_DISPATCH_MAP` whose issue has not yet reached a terminal `workflow:*` label (per Step 4B's `classify_predecessor_state()`).
2. Call `TaskStop(task_id)` (the harness tool) for each one, in the same turn, before ending the session.
3. Call `release_orchestrator_lease()` (Step 4A-pre.-1) so a future resume or a different operator is not blocked by a stale lease from this now-stopped session.
4. Report which issues had in-flight dispatch stopped mid-pipeline (their `workflow:*` label will reflect whatever phase they reached — a future `/work-on {NUMBER}` or orchestrator resume picks them back up from GitHub state, per the Universal Phase Dispatcher in `commands/work-on.md`).

**This is a documentation/behavioral contract, not a bash block**: unlike the lease gate above, there is no shell construct that reliably intercepts "the orchestrator's own session is being stopped" — that is a harness-level event the orchestrating agent must handle in its own turn when it observes an interrupt, using its own tools (`TaskStop`), exactly the way `commands/orchestrate/phase-5-cleanup.md` already documents cleanup as an agent-driven procedure rather than a background script.

**Known limitation — Windows Git Bash (documented, not silently overclaimed)**: Even a harness-issued `TaskStop` against the tracked background task is not guaranteed to terminate the underlying `forgedock run-issue` Win32 process tree on Windows Git Bash — MSYS-launched child processes are not always attached to the parent's job object in a way that a stop signal reliably cascades through. `TaskStop` is the correct in-spec, harness-native mitigation and closes the common case (an operator deliberately stopping a live, still-running orchestrator session). It does **not** guarantee full termination in every case — per the issue's own report, an operator may still need to fall back to a manual, command-line-matched kill as a belt-and-suspenders measure:

```powershell
# Windows fallback — only if a forgedock run-issue process is confirmed still running
# after TaskStop (e.g. `docker ps` / dispatch-state still show activity post-stop):
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -match 'forgedock run-issue' } | ForEach-Object {
  Stop-Process -Id $_.ProcessId -Force
}
```

Do not claim `TaskStop` eliminates every zombie-process scenario on Windows; it eliminates the scenario this issue's fix is scoped to (an operator or harness cleanly stopping a live orchestrator session that is still tracking its own dispatched tasks) — the PowerShell fallback above remains documented for the narrower case where the underlying process tree survives regardless.

### Step 4A-pre.0: Budget initialization (MANDATORY when --budget is set) <!-- Added: forge#1743 -->

Initialize budget tracking state before the first dispatch. Read `--budget N` from the orchestrator's argument list (passed from the top-level `/orchestrate` invocation). When `--budget` is not set, `BUDGET_LIMIT` is `Infinity` (uncapped — current default behavior preserved).

```bash
# --- Budget initialization ---
# Parse --budget N from ARGUMENTS (e.g. /orchestrate fast-lane --budget 5.00)
BUDGET_LIMIT=$(echo "${ARGUMENTS:-}" | grep -oP '(?<=--budget )\S+' | head -1 || echo "")
if [ -z "$BUDGET_LIMIT" ] || ! echo "$BUDGET_LIMIT" | grep -qP '^\d+(\.\d+)?$'; then
  BUDGET_LIMIT="Infinity"
fi

PROJECTED_SPEND="0"          # sum of ISSUE_COST_ESTIMATE[] for dispatched issues
ACTUAL_SPEND="0"             # sum of actual cost reported by completed agents (best-effort)
DEFERRED_BUDGET_ISSUES=()    # issues deferred because projected spend would exceed budget
EPSILON_DISPATCHED=false     # true once at least one ε-reserve issue has been dispatched

if [ "$BUDGET_LIMIT" != "Infinity" ]; then
  EPSILON_BUDGET=$(echo "scale=4; $BUDGET_LIMIT * 0.10" | bc 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
  echo "Budget initialized: BUDGET_LIMIT=\$${BUDGET_LIMIT} EPSILON_BUDGET=\$${EPSILON_BUDGET} (10% ε-reserve)"
  echo "Issues without cost priors (ε-reserve eligible): ${NO_PRIOR_ISSUES[*]:-none}"
else
  EPSILON_BUDGET="0"
  echo "Budget: uncapped (no --budget flag) — dispatching all ready issues by score order"
fi
# --- End budget initialization ---
```

**Budget halt condition** (checked in Step 4A before each dispatch):

Before dispatching issue `NUM`, check whether its estimated cost would exceed the remaining budget:

```bash
# Check budget before dispatching NUM
should_dispatch() {
  local NUM="$1"
  local COST="${ISSUE_COST_ESTIMATE[$NUM]:-0.35}"

  if [ "$BUDGET_LIMIT" = "Infinity" ]; then
    return 0  # uncapped — always dispatch
  fi

  NEW_PROJECTED=$(echo "scale=4; $PROJECTED_SPEND + $COST" | bc 2>/dev/null || echo "$PROJECTED_SPEND")
  MAIN_CEILING=$(echo "scale=4; $BUDGET_LIMIT - $EPSILON_BUDGET" | bc 2>/dev/null || echo "$BUDGET_LIMIT")

  # ε-reserve logic: if this is a no-prior issue AND ε-budget has not yet been
  # used AND the no-prior issue has NOT been dispatched yet, allow it even if
  # the main ceiling is hit (up to BUDGET_LIMIT total).
  if [ "${ISSUE_HAS_PRIOR[$NUM]:-false}" = "false" ] && [ "$EPSILON_DISPATCHED" = "false" ]; then
    if echo "$NEW_PROJECTED $BUDGET_LIMIT" | awk '{exit ($1 <= $2) ? 0 : 1}' 2>/dev/null; then
      EPSILON_DISPATCHED=true
      echo "ε-reserve: dispatching #${NUM} (no-prior issue) from exploration reserve"
      return 0
    fi
  fi

  # Main budget check: defer if projected would exceed main ceiling
  if echo "$NEW_PROJECTED $MAIN_CEILING" | awk '{exit ($1 <= $2) ? 0 : 1}' 2>/dev/null; then
    DEFERRED_BUDGET_ISSUES+=("$NUM")
    echo "BUDGET DEFER: #${NUM} (est. \$${COST}) would push projected spend to \$${NEW_PROJECTED} > main ceiling \$${MAIN_CEILING}"
    return 1
  fi

  return 0
}
```

**Budget deferred-issues report** (output when `BUDGET_LIMIT` is finite and `DEFERRED_BUDGET_ISSUES` is non-empty — print at end of Phase 4, before Phase 5):

```
## Budget Report

**Budget limit**: $${BUDGET_LIMIT}
**Projected spend (dispatched issues)**: $${PROJECTED_SPEND}
**ε-reserve used**: ${EPSILON_DISPATCHED} (10% = $${EPSILON_BUDGET})

### Deferred Issues (budget exhausted — never silently dropped)

| Issue | Title | Score | Est. Cost | Reason |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| #{N} | {title} | {score} | ${cost} | Budget ceiling reached |

**Action**: Re-run `/orchestrate {deferred_issue_numbers} [--budget N]` to process deferred issues, or increase `--budget`.
```

**When `BUDGET_LIMIT = Infinity`**: skip this check and report entirely — uncapped behavior.

### Step 4A-pre.0.2: Concurrency gate initialization (MANDATORY) <!-- Added: forge#1912 -->

**WHY THIS EXISTS** <!-- Added: forge#1912 -->: Phase 4's dispatch loops previously launched every DAG-ready issue in one shot — the engine-first bash loop backgrounded every `should_dispatch()`-passing issue with no count limit, and the Agent-spawn-fallback path was explicitly instructed to "launch all ready agents simultaneously." On a large ready set this saturates the Anthropic API rate limit in one burst, causing cascading failures across most of the batch. This is a distinct, count-denominated gate from the dollar-denominated `--budget` gate above (Step 4A-pre.0) — an issue can be deferred for budget reasons, concurrency reasons, or both; each gate accumulates its own deferred list independently.

`MAX_CONCURRENT` caps top-level `/work-on` dispatches, not the total number of harness subagents. A normal worker can spawn context, architect, implement, validate, quality-gate, and review children. Budget **8 total subagent spawns per worker** when choosing this value: `max_concurrent <= session_subagent_budget / 8`. This is a conservative planning multiplier, not a second runtime semaphore; the harness does not expose a reliable cross-agent spawn counter to this shell-level dispatcher.

Initialize the concurrency cap and its batch-scope tracking state before the first dispatch:

```bash
# --- Concurrency gate initialization ---
MAX_CONCURRENT=$(yq '.orchestration.max_concurrent // 12' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo 12)

# Validate MAX_CONCURRENT is a bare positive integer before it is ever used in arithmetic
# expansion or array-slice-length position below. Bash's `$(( ))` and `${arr[@]:off:len}`
# both re-evaluate an unquoted variable's contents as an expression — an unvalidated value
# (e.g. a malicious or malformed forge.yaml, or a stray non-numeric string) can inject
# arbitrary command substitution into the arithmetic context, and 0/negative values make
# the chunked dispatch loop below (Step 4A) never advance its index, spinning forever.
# Same validation convention as BUDGET_LIMIT in Step 4A-pre.0 above. <!-- Added: forge#1912 -->
if [ "$MAX_CONCURRENT" = "null" ] || ! echo "$MAX_CONCURRENT" | grep -qP '^[1-9][0-9]*$'; then
  echo "WARNING: forge.yaml → orchestration.max_concurrent is not a positive integer (\"${MAX_CONCURRENT}\") — falling back to default 12"
  MAX_CONCURRENT=12
fi

ACTIVE_DISPATCH_COUNT=0             # in-flight dispatched-but-not-yet-completed agents, this batch
DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES=()      # ready issues held back because no headroom was available
SUBAGENT_SPAWN_BUDGET_PER_WORKER=8  # /work-on + build/review fan-out planning estimate
TOP_LEVEL_DISPATCH_TOTAL=0
PLANNED_SUBAGENT_SPAWNS=0
OBSERVED_SUBAGENT_SPAWNS="unavailable" # replace only with harness telemetry; never infer

echo "Concurrency gate initialized: MAX_CONCURRENT=${MAX_CONCURRENT}; plan for up to $((MAX_CONCURRENT * SUBAGENT_SPAWN_BUDGET_PER_WORKER)) subagent spawns in flight (8 per worker)"
# --- End concurrency gate initialization ---
```

**Headroom helper** (used by every dispatch site below — Step 4A's engine-first loop, Step 4A's Agent-spawn-fallback path, and Step 4B's newly-ready dispatch):

```bash
dispatch_headroom() {
  local HEADROOM=$((MAX_CONCURRENT - ACTIVE_DISPATCH_COUNT))
  [ "$HEADROOM" -lt 0 ] && HEADROOM=0
  echo "$HEADROOM"
}
```

**This is a hard cap, not a suggestion.** No dispatch site in Phase 4 may background/spawn more than `dispatch_headroom` new agents without first waiting for in-flight agents to complete. Issues that cannot be dispatched due to the cap go into `DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES[]` and are released — in the order they were deferred — as running agents complete (Step 4B), the same event-driven model (no sleep/poll loops) the file already uses for DAG-readiness and budget gating.

**Dispatch accounting**: Immediately after each successful top-level dispatch, increment `TOP_LEVEL_DISPATCH_TOTAL` and add `SUBAGENT_SPAWN_BUDGET_PER_WORKER` to `PLANNED_SUBAGENT_SPAWNS`. When the runtime reports child-spawn telemetry, replace `OBSERVED_SUBAGENT_SPAWNS` with that measured total; otherwise leave it `unavailable` rather than fabricating a measured value.

### Step 4A-pre.0.3: Secondary content-creation backpressure (MANDATORY)

GitHub's `resources.core` quota does not report secondary content-creation throttles. Treat any GitHub API response with HTTP `403` whose body contains `secondary rate limit` as a batch-wide backpressure signal.

```bash
# Call from every dispatcher-owned gh write/create wrapper and from a child completion
# report that includes its final GitHub API error. Do not retry the failed request here.
SECONDARY_RATE_LIMITED=false
SECONDARY_RATE_LIMIT_MESSAGE=""

record_secondary_rate_limit() {
  local STATUS="$1"
  local BODY="$2"
  if [ "$STATUS" = "403" ] && echo "$BODY" | grep -qi 'secondary rate limit'; then
    SECONDARY_RATE_LIMITED=true
    SECONDARY_RATE_LIMIT_MESSAGE="$BODY"
    echo "SECONDARY RATE LIMIT: pausing all new dispatch. Do not retry GitHub content creation until an operator resumes the batch." >&2
  fi
}
```

Before every dispatch site computes headroom or launches a worker, check `SECONDARY_RATE_LIMITED`. When true, preserve the ready/deferred queues, launch no more workers, and end the active dispatch cycle. Do not poll or retry GitHub calls to discover recovery: an operator resumes the batch after the throttle clears. In-flight agents receive this contract in the dispatch prompt: on a secondary-limit 403, they must stop their GitHub write/create retry loop, report the response to the orchestrator, and exit their current phase without creating replacement work.

### Step 4A-pre: Staging baseline tracking (MANDATORY — continuous)

**WHY THIS EXISTS**: Milestone-code-onto-staging contamination incidents (see issue #150) produce unexpected growth on the staging branch that is otherwise invisible until after a deploy. In the streaming DAG model, there are no discrete wave boundaries — instead, track a running baseline and check after each agent completion.

**When to run**: Capture the initial baseline before the first dispatch. Then re-check after every agent that merges a PR targeting `staging`. Skip for pure milestone-branch batches where all issues target `milestone/*`.

```bash
# Capture initial staging baseline before first dispatch
git fetch origin
if [ "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" = "$STAGING_BRANCH" ]; then
  STAGING_LINES_BASELINE=0
  echo "Staging baseline: skipped — single-branch repo (staging == default)"
else
  STAGING_LINES_BASELINE=$(git diff --stat origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH...origin/$STAGING_BRANCH 2>/dev/null \
    | tail -1 \
    | grep -oP '\d+ insertion' \
    | grep -oP '\d+' \
    || echo "0")
  echo "Staging baseline: ${STAGING_LINES_BASELINE} lines ahead of $DEFAULT_BRANCH"
fi

# Track cumulative expected growth from merged PRs
CUMULATIVE_EXPECTED_DELTA=0
```

**Per-agent-completion integrity check** (run in Step 4B after each agent merges a PR targeting staging):

```bash
# After agent completes and its PR merges to staging:
git fetch origin
if [ "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" != "$STAGING_BRANCH" ]; then
  STAGING_LINES_NOW=$(git diff --stat origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH...origin/$STAGING_BRANCH 2>/dev/null \
    | tail -1 \
    | grep -oP '\d+ insertion' \
    | grep -oP '\d+' \
    || echo "0")
  STAGING_TOTAL_GROWTH=$((STAGING_LINES_NOW - STAGING_LINES_BASELINE))

  # Add this PR's line count to cumulative expected delta
  CUMULATIVE_EXPECTED_DELTA=$((CUMULATIVE_EXPECTED_DELTA + {THIS_PR_LINE_COUNT}))

  UNEXPECTED_GROWTH=$((STAGING_TOTAL_GROWTH - CUMULATIVE_EXPECTED_DELTA))
  if [ "$UNEXPECTED_GROWTH" -gt 500 ]; then
    echo "ALERT: Staging grew by ${STAGING_TOTAL_GROWTH} lines (+${UNEXPECTED_GROWTH} beyond expected ${CUMULATIVE_EXPECTED_DELTA})."
    echo "This may indicate milestone-code contamination via agent merge commits."
    echo "Review: git log --oneline --merges origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH..origin/$STAGING_BRANCH"
    echo "Do NOT merge $STAGING_BRANCH → $DEFAULT_BRANCH until the unexpected growth is investigated."
    # Do NOT auto-stop — alert the user and let them decide
  fi
fi
```

If `UNEXPECTED_GROWTH > 500`, report the alert clearly before dispatching any more agents. The user confirms whether to continue.

### Step 4A.pre.0: Pre-create milestone branches for ready issues (MANDATORY before classify-lane) <!-- Added: forge#901 -->

**WHY THIS EXISTS**: Feature-lane milestone branches were created lazily — by whichever feature-lane agent reached its build phase first. When multiple agents are dispatched simultaneously, they each run the lane check at roughly the same time. Every agent that runs before the branch is first pushed observes "branch absent" and is misrouted (hard-fail / `needs-human`, or fallback to staging in older code paths). The result is a single milestone's PRs scattered across the milestone branch and staging — a branch-routing nondeterminism that recurs under parallelism.

The fix is deterministic: create every milestone branch the ready issues will target **once, up front, before any agent runs `classify-lane.sh`**. After this step, every agent's lane check sees the branch and routes consistently.

**When to run**: Before the classify-lane loop in Step 4A.pre, for every dispatch group (initial ready set + each subsequent batch of newly unblocked issues). The step is a no-op for pure fast-lane issues (no issue in the group has a milestone).

**Requires bash 4+**: This snippet uses an associative array (`declare -A SEEN_MILESTONE_SLUG`) to de-dupe milestone slugs, so it must run under bash 4 or newer. Under a non-bash POSIX shell (`sh`/dash), `declare -A` fails and the de-dupe silently no-ops. This degrades gracefully — branch creation stays correct because the `git ls-remote --exit-code` exists-check below still skips any milestone branch that already exists; the only effect is redundant, idempotent `ls-remote`/`push` attempts for milestones referenced by more than one issue. Run this command's blocks under bash 4+. <!-- Added: forge#901 -->

```bash
# Pre-create the origin milestone branch for every distinct milestone referenced by ready issues.
# Slugification MUST byte-match scripts/classify-lane.sh — otherwise a branch is created that
# the classifier will not select. Keep these two slug pipelines identical.
git fetch origin

# Collect distinct milestone titles among the ready issues
declare -A SEEN_MILESTONE_SLUG
for NUM in {ready_issue_numbers}; do
  MILESTONE_TITLE=$(gh issue view "$NUM" -R {GH_REPO} --json milestone --jq '.milestone.title // empty' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
  [ -z "$MILESTONE_TITLE" ] && continue  # fast-lane issue — no milestone branch needed

  # Slugify — IDENTICAL to classify-lane.sh: lowercase → spaces-to-hyphens →
  # strip non-[a-z0-9-] → collapse hyphens → strip leading/trailing hyphens.
  SLUG=$(echo "$MILESTONE_TITLE" \
    | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
    | tr ' ' '-' \
    | tr -cd 'a-z0-9-' \
    | sed 's/--*/-/g' \
    | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//')

  # Empty-slug guard (matches classify-lane.sh): a title with no ASCII letters/digits/hyphens
  # would produce "milestone/", an invalid ref. Skip and let classify-lane surface the error.
  if [ -z "$SLUG" ]; then
    echo "WARN: milestone title '$MILESTONE_TITLE' (issue #$NUM) produced an empty slug — skipping pre-creation; classify-lane will hard-fail." >&2
    continue
  fi

  # De-dupe: only attempt creation once per milestone
  [ -n "${SEEN_MILESTONE_SLUG[$SLUG]:-}" ] && continue
  SEEN_MILESTONE_SLUG[$SLUG]=1

  LANE="milestone/$SLUG"
  if git ls-remote --exit-code origin "$LANE" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Milestone branch '$LANE' already exists on origin — no action."
    continue
  fi

  # Create-if-absent from the default branch (matches /milestone create).
  # $DEFAULT_BRANCH is resolved from forge.yaml at the top of this command.
  echo "Pre-creating milestone branch '$LANE' from origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH …"
  if git push origin "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH:refs/heads/$LANE" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Created milestone branch '$LANE'."
  elif git ls-remote --exit-code origin "$LANE" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # A concurrent orchestrator (or an agent) created it first — harmless. Never force-push.
    echo "Milestone branch '$LANE' was created concurrently — proceeding with the existing branch."
  else
    echo "ERROR: failed to pre-create milestone branch '$LANE' from origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH." >&2
    echo "       classify-lane.sh will hard-fail for issues in this milestone until the branch exists." >&2
  fi
done
```

This step is the deterministic counterpart to fix #2 (atomic create-if-absent in the classifier): by guaranteeing the branch exists before the lane checks run, no agent can observe a missing branch. `classify-lane.sh`'s hard-fail is intentionally preserved as the phantom-slug gate for any path that bypasses this step.

### Step 4A.pre: Classify lane for each issue (MANDATORY before dispatching agents)

Before building agent prompts, run `classify-lane.sh` for every issue in the current dispatch group to compute `{LANE}` and `{PR_BASE}` deterministically. The script output is authoritative — the LLM MUST NOT override or reason around it.

```bash
# Resolve the helper once and reuse it for the initial dispatch and all finding
# classification loops. Claude keeps its installed path as the default, while
# OpenCode and Codex can use ForgeDock's repository-local scripts.
resolve_classify_lane() {
  local candidates=()
  if [ "${FORGE_RUNTIME:-}" = "opencode" ] ||
     [ -n "${OPENCODE_SESSION_ID:-}" ] ||
     [ -n "${OPENCODE_PID:-}" ] ||
     [ -n "${OPENCODE:-}" ]; then
    [ -n "${FORGE_HOME:-}" ] && candidates+=("$FORGE_HOME/scripts/classify-lane.sh")
    [ -n "${REPO_PATH:-}" ] && candidates+=("$REPO_PATH/scripts/classify-lane.sh")

  fi

  for candidate in "${candidates[@]}"; do
    if [ -f "$candidate" ]; then
      printf '%s\n' "$candidate"
      return 0
    fi
  done
  echo "ERROR: classify-lane.sh is not installed in any configured runtime path." >&2
  return 1
}

  echo "ERROR: cannot classify lanes without classify-lane.sh" >&2
  exit 1
}

### Step 4A: Dispatch ready issues

### Step 4A.0: Probe Knowledge Gist capability once

Probe the authenticated identity once for this orchestration run before any engine, Agent, or
OpenCode worker is dispatched. A GitHub App installation token identifies as `Bot` and cannot use
the Gists API; cache that fact rather than letting every worker rediscover it by attempting a
write. An unavailable identity probe preserves existing behavior for PAT-authenticated runs.

```bash
if [ -z "${FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE+x}" ]; then
  GIST_AUTH_TYPE=$(gh api user --jq '.type' 2>/dev/null || true)
  if [ "$GIST_AUTH_TYPE" = "Bot" ]; then
    FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE=false
  else
    FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE=true
  fi
  export FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE
fi

if [ "$FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE" = "true" ]; then
  echo "Knowledge Gist capability available"
else
  echo "INFO: Knowledge Gist subsystem unavailable for this authentication; workers will skip it"
fi
```

Carry `FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE` unchanged through every dispatch path. Do not probe it in individual
workers dispatched by this run. Phase 6 reports a false value once at batch level.

**Claims-board dispatch gate (MANDATORY, before every individual dispatch)** <!-- Added: forge#2844 -->: The coordination issue is the durable authority for file ownership. Do not use `EDGE_FILES`, `ISSUE_FILES`, or a remembered prior read as evidence that a claim is free. Immediately before dispatching each issue, re-read the full claims board and refuse that dispatch when the issue's declared file set intersects a live claim held by another issue. This applies equally to engine, Claude Agent, and OpenCode task dispatches, including newly-ready issues and wake reconstruction.

```bash
# Returns unreleased claims as [{holder: "123", files: "..."}]. A release is a separate,
# later comment, so it must be paired with its claim by holder rather than searched for in the
# claim comment itself. Terminal holder states also self-heal claims left behind by dead agents.

```

**Engine-first dispatch (default)**: When `forgedock` is in PATH, dispatch each ready issue via the durable engine rather than spawning prose Agent sub-agents. The engine's phase table enforces gate semantics in code — its fail-closed review gate and deterministic phase ordering are not subject to LLM interpretation.

**OpenCode dispatch (runtime-neutral adapter)**: When `FORGE_RUNTIME=opencode` or
an OpenCode runtime marker is present, do not invoke the engine's Claude-backed
runner and do not use the Claude `Agent(...)` fallback. Dispatch each ready
issue through OpenCode's native `task` tool, loading the nested
`commands/work-on.md` pipeline. Use GitHub labels and `FORGE:*` comments as the
resume state. After each task continuation, re-read the issue workflow label
and continue until it reaches
`workflow:merged`, `workflow:invalid`, `needs-human`, or
`workflow:awaiting-merge`.

The native call is asynchronous and must be issued once per issue in
`DISPATCH_NOW`, in the same assistant message where the batch is dispatched:

```
task(
  description="Work on {PROJECT_PREFIX}#{NUMBER}",
  subagent_type="general",
  background=true,
  prompt="Use the same Phase 4A work-on template below. Before invoking it, run `export FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE={FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE}` so the cached orchestration capability is preserved. Invoke Skill(skill='work-on', args='{PROJECT_PREFIX}{NUMBER} --under-orchestration') and continue until a terminal workflow state."
)
```

Capture the returned `<task id="..." state="running">` id in
`OPENCODE_DISPATCH_MAP[{NUMBER}]` and immediately persist it to the issue:

```bash
ATTEMPT=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/{NUMBER}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains("FORGE:DISPATCH") and contains("\"state\":\"running\""))] | length + 1')
if [ "${DRY_RUN:-false}" = "false" ]; then
  gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "<!-- FORGE:DISPATCH -->
\`\`\`json
{\"runtime\":\"opencode\",\"child_session_id\":\"{TASK_ID}\",\"attempt\":${ATTEMPT},\"state\":\"running\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}
\`\`\`"
fi
```

`background=true` is required for streaming DAG behavior; a foreground task
makes the orchestrator wait for that issue and reintroduces a wave barrier. The ForgeDock OpenCode plugin opts into
`OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true` by default. An explicit
`OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=false` is a supported degraded mode,
but it must be reported as non-streaming rather than treated as equivalent to
Claude background dispatch. Do not wait for the slowest sibling before handling
an earlier task-result event.

```bash
if [ "${FORGE_RUNTIME:-}" = "opencode" ]; then
  echo "OpenCode native task dispatch selected — load commands/work-on.md for each ready issue."
  echo "Do not call forgedock run-issue or the Claude Agent(...) fallback in this branch."
  echo "Use task(subagent_type=general, background=true) once per ready issue and process each task-result event immediately."
  echo "If native task dispatch cannot run, post FORGE:OPENCODE_BLOCKED with the missing capability and add needs-human."
fi
```

This branch is additive. When OpenCode is not selected, continue through the
existing engine-first and Claude Agent-spawn paths below without modification.

The generated OpenCode plugin is an executable boundary, not just prompt
guidance: its `tool.execute.before` hook rejects `claude`, `forgedock
run-issue`, `npx forgedock run-issue`, and recursive `opencode run` shell
commands with `FORGE_OPENCODE_CAPABILITY_ERROR`. If a native Skill or Task is
unavailable, stop with that bounded error and preserve the GitHub label state;
never compensate by starting a second controller or the Claude-backed engine.

**CRITICAL — never background via shell `&`/`wait`** (fixed forge#2466): A single `forgedock run-issue` invocation drives an issue through investigate → build → review → close and routinely runs 30+ minutes. Backgrounding the process at the *shell* level (`cmd &` … `wait`) does not escape the Bash tool's own per-invocation ceiling — `wait` is itself the foreground command the tool watches, and it blocks for the combined duration of every process in the chunk. This made engine-first dispatch effectively dead code: any chunk running longer than the ceiling was always killed, so every run silently fell through to the Agent-spawn fallback below. The fix: dispatch each `forgedock run-issue` invocation as its **own `Bash` tool call with `run_in_background=true`** — the harness's native "start it, don't wait, notify me on completion" primitive — never with shell-level `&`/`wait`. This is exactly the same async model the Agent-spawn-fallback path already uses (and Step 4B's notification-driven completion loop already expects), so one monitoring loop now covers both dispatch styles.

**Dispatch each issue in `DISPATCH_NOW` via its own backgrounded `Bash` call (MANDATORY when `FORGEDOCK_AVAILABLE=true`) — never shell `&`/`wait`.** Immediately before each call, run `claim_conflicts_with_live_holder "{NUM}"`; if it returns success, defer that issue rather than dispatching it. Issue one `Bash(...)` call per remaining issue in `DISPATCH_NOW`, all in the same message, so they run concurrently within the headroom already computed above:

```
Bash(command="FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE=${FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE} forgedock run-issue {NUM} --lane {PR_BASE}", run_in_background=true, description="Engine-drive issue #{NUM}")
```

Capture the task id each call returns into `ENGINE_DISPATCH_MAP[{NUM}]` (declared alongside `AGENT_ISSUE_MAP` below — Step 4B's completion handler uses this map to identify which issue a backgrounded engine-mode `Bash` completion notification belongs to, the same role `AGENT_ISSUE_MAP` plays for `agent_completed` notifications):

```
# After the batch of Bash(run_in_background=true, ...) calls, capture each returned task id:
ENGINE_DISPATCH_MAP[{NUM}] = <task_id returned by Bash(run_in_background=true, ...)>
```

`ENGINE_DISPATCH_MAP` starts empty and accumulates one entry per dispatched issue, exactly like `AGENT_ISSUE_MAP` below. After the batch, increment `ACTIVE_DISPATCH_COUNT` by `${#DISPATCH_NOW[@]}` — identical accounting to the Agent-spawn path's own post-batch increment.

If `DISPATCH_NOW` is empty (headroom is 0), do not dispatch any issues this cycle — wait for the next completion notification, exactly like the Agent-spawn path.

**Agent-spawn path (Claude fallback when forgedock CLI unavailable)**: When `FORGEDOCK_AVAILABLE=false` and the runtime is not OpenCode, spawn Agent sub-agents per issue using the template below. This preserves engine state via the SubagentStop hook even without the CLI.

When the runtime is OpenCode, skip this Claude-only `Agent(...)` path entirely.
Use the native `task` call above for initial and newly-ready issue dispatches.
Translate only those OpenCode orchestration dispatches to `task(...)` with
`subagent_type="general"` and `background=true`. Review and remediation are
load-bearing child operations and must run foreground. Do not claim task-id
resume support: after a restart, reconcile the latest `FORGE:DISPATCH` record
with durable GitHub workflow state, then dispatch a fresh work-on continuation
only when the issue is still non-terminal.

**REMINDER: You MUST use the template below verbatim when on the Agent-spawn fallback path. Only fill in `{VARIABLES}`. Do NOT rewrite the agent prompt. Do NOT write custom implementation instructions. The agent MUST invoke `/work-on` via the Skill tool — this is the HARD RULE from the top of this file.**

For each **ready** issue (all predecessors resolved or no predecessors), spawn an Agent sub-agent that runs the full `/work-on` pipeline. On the initial dispatch, this is every issue with an empty predecessor set. On subsequent dispatches (triggered by agent completions in Step 4B), this is every newly-unblocked issue.

**One agent per issue.** Do NOT group multiple issues into a single agent. `/work-on` handles branching, labels, and PRs per-issue.

**Copy this template. Fill in variables. Do not modify the structure:**

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="{SUBAGENT_MODEL}",
  description="Work on {PROJECT_PREFIX}#{NUMBER}",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="You are working on GitHub issue #{NUMBER} for the {PROJECT_NAME} project.

**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME}
**Repository**: {GH_REPO}
**Repo path**: {REPO_PATH}

**KNOWLEDGE GIST CAPABILITY**: This orchestration already probed it: `{FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE}`. Before invoking `/work-on`, run `export FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE={FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE}`. Do not re-probe or attempt Gist creation when it is `false`.

**YOUR MISSION**: Invoke `/work-on` via the Skill tool and let it run to completion. `/work-on` is a self-contained routing loop that handles the ENTIRE pipeline: investigate → build (context → architect → implement → validate) → review (push → PR → /review-pr --auto-merge) → close (project board → trajectory log → worktree cleanup). Do NOT intervene, compensate, or manually close issues — `/work-on` handles everything including issue closure and label updates in its close phase.

**CRITICAL — DO NOT STOP EARLY**: /work-on runs as a multi-phase routing loop. Each phase (investigate, build, review, close) returns an intermediate result — these are NOT completion signals. You are NOT done until the issue reaches a terminal state: `workflow:merged`, `workflow:invalid`, `needs-human`, or `workflow:awaiting-merge`. If /work-on returns after only one phase (e.g., investigation), you MUST invoke it again immediately — it will re-read GitHub state and continue to the next phase. Keep invoking /work-on until it reaches a terminal state. Never output 'done' or stop after an intermediate result.

**HOW REVIEW FINDINGS WORK**: /review-pr may create GitHub issues (with `review-finding` label) for findings it discovers. These are NOT blockers — they are separate work items that will go through their own /work-on pipeline later. The original PR should ALWAYS merge after review. The only exception is build errors (code doesn't compile) — those must be fixed before merging.

**IMPORTANT RULES**:
- **MANDATORY**: You MUST use the Skill tool to invoke 'work-on' with args '{PROJECT_PREFIX}{NUMBER}'. Do NOT implement manually — /work-on handles the full pipeline including label state machine (workflow:investigating → workflow:building → workflow:in-review → workflow:merged), investigation reports, PR creation, and cleanup.
  - For default repo issues: `Skill(skill='work-on', args='{NUMBER} --under-orchestration')`
  - For satellite repo issues: `Skill(skill='work-on', args='{SATELLITE_PREFIX}:{NUMBER} --under-orchestration')` (prefix from forge.yaml → repos.satellites)
  - The `--under-orchestration` flag tells `/work-on` to post its phase-entry `FORGE:HEARTBEAT` comments (Phases 0/1/3/5) — this orchestrator's Step 4B.5 stall detector depends on those timestamps. A solo `/work-on` run omits the flag and skips those writes entirely (see `commands/work-on.md` → Orchestration Flag).
- NEVER bypass /work-on with manual git/gh commands — the label updates and structured comments are critical for tracking
- **File-backed GitHub bodies — entity scope plus read-back is mandatory**: Never stage a `gh --body-file` body at a generic shared `/tmp` path, including one made by bare `mktemp`, and never hand-roll a root-level path such as `/tmp_invbody_31076.txt`, which can hang unattended cleanup. Prefer the session scratchpad or a repo-relative scratch directory on Windows: a native Windows `gh` may not resolve Git Bash `/tmp` reliably. Create a filename that contains the target issue/PR number and an agent-unique token, then use `mktemp` for its random suffix. Put one caller-chosen marker such as `<!-- FORGE:BODY-INTEGRITY:${NUMBER}_investigator_${AGENT_TOKEN} -->` in the body. After every `gh issue create|edit` or `gh pr create|comment` using `--body-file`, re-read the target object and assert the exact marker is present; a mismatch is a hard error. Unique names reduce collisions, but only read-back detects a collision that substitutes plausible-looking content from another agent. Do not rely on eyeballing. (forge#2843, forge#2855) <!-- allowlist:check-command-side-effects -->
- **GitHub secondary rate limit**: If a GitHub API call returns HTTP 403 with `secondary rate limit` in its response, do NOT retry it or start a polling loop. Stop GitHub content creation for this phase, report the status and response body to the orchestrator in your final result, and wait for a later batch resume. Retrying extends the throttle for every sibling.
- **Temp files — ALWAYS use `mktemp`, NEVER hand-roll a path**: You are one of several agents running concurrently on this host and you share its `/tmp` with all of them. Any time you stage content in a temp file before passing it to `gh` (e.g. `--body-file`), create that path with `mktemp` (e.g. `BODY_FILE="$(mktemp)"`). Never write a temp file to a single-segment root path such as `/tmp_invbody_31076.txt`: Claude Code treats removing it as dangerous and requires an explicit approval that bypass mode cannot clear, hanging unattended runs. Also never use a fixed literal such as `/tmp/body.md` or `/tmp/issue.json`: a fixed path collides with another concurrently-running agent and can silently overwrite the content you staged (or you can silently overwrite theirs) before either of you reads it back. Safe: `BODY_FILE="$(mktemp)"`. Unsafe: `/tmp_invbody_31076.txt` (a missing slash that creates a root-level path) and `/tmp/body.md` (a fixed path). `mktemp` costs nothing and prevents both failures. (forge#2198, forge#2855)
- **`docker cp` — NEVER write into a bind-mounted shared container**: If the project you're working on runs its dev/test containers with a bind mount to the main (non-worktree) checkout, `docker cp` into that container writes through the mount into the main checkout — not your isolated per-issue worktree. Before running `docker cp` into any container, confirm its mount source is your own worktree, not a shared/main one; if you can't confirm that, don't assume an in-container test run reflects your feature branch. (forge#2198)
- NEVER target `main` for PRs targeting the default repo. Use `{STAGING_BRANCH}` for fast-lane issues, or `milestone/{slug}` for milestone issues.
- Satellite repos (MCP, n8n) have no staging branch — fast-lane PRs go to `main` for those.
- If the issue is INVALID after investigation, close it with a comment explaining why
- If you hit merge conflicts or blockers, post a comment on the issue and STOP — do not force anything
- Do not interact with the user — you are running autonomously in the background
- **NEVER ask the user questions** — you are a background agent. If review finds issues, auto-fix simple ones and proceed, then let `/review-pr`'s own verdict decide: APPROVED (no unresolved CONFIRMED HIGH/CRITICAL finding) → merge to `staging` and create follow-up issues for the rest, **regardless of domain**. Domain alone (AUTH, BILLING, DATABASE, or any domain tagged as security-critical in Step 3B) is NOT a reason to add `needs-human` and stop — `staging` is reversible; the real human deploy gate is `staging → main`, not this merge. <!-- Added: forge#1815 --> `needs-human` is reserved for what the pipeline genuinely cannot do itself: spend/procurement decisions, real-environment validation it has no access to, product/architecture judgment calls a human must make, or `/review-pr`'s existing evidence-based escalations (spec-evolution guard, novel task-type/module-combo trust escalation, calibration-based overconfidence routing). An unresolved CONFIRMED HIGH/CRITICAL finding is `/review-pr`'s own withheld-APPROVED case, not a domain-driven `needs-human` halt — `/review-pr` already refuses to return APPROVED when that's true, so there is no separate domain check to perform here.

**LABEL-STATE LOOP CONTRACT — enforce after EVERY Skill return**:
After EVERY `Skill(skill='work-on', ...)` call returns, immediately check the issue's current workflow label:
```bash
gh issue view {NUMBER} -R {GH_REPO} --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name | select(startswith("workflow:"))]'
```
**Terminal labels** (only these allow you to stop): `workflow:merged`, `workflow:invalid`
**Terminal condition also**: `needs-human` label present, `workflow:awaiting-merge` label present, OR issue state is `closed`
`needs-human` and `workflow:awaiting-merge` are terminal-FOR-THIS-AGENT (this individual `/work-on` run stops here — a human decision or merge is now the blocking step) but are NOT "done" from the DAG's point of view; see Predecessor Classification in Step 4B for how the orchestrator's dependency logic treats them (`GATED`, not `DONE`).
If the label is NOT terminal (e.g., `workflow:investigating`, `workflow:ready-to-build`, `workflow:building`, `workflow:in-review`), invoke `Skill(skill='work-on', args='{NUMBER} --under-orchestration')` again immediately. The `/work-on` skill will re-read GitHub state and advance to the next phase. Do NOT output a summary, do NOT pause, do NOT ask for confirmation — just invoke it again.

**CRITICAL — SOURCE BRANCH DETECTION**:
- If the issue has the `review-finding` label, read the issue body for `**Code branch**: \`{branch}\``
- If found, that is the SOURCE_BRANCH — the code ONLY exists on that branch (e.g., `staging`), NOT on `origin/main`
- Investigation MUST use `git show origin/{SOURCE_BRANCH}:{filepath}` to verify the code exists
- Worktree MUST branch from `origin/{SOURCE_BRANCH}`, NOT `origin/main`
- PR target is `{SOURCE_BRANCH}` (the fix goes back to where the code lives)

**LANE**: {LANE} (PR target: {PR_BASE})
**Issue title**: {ISSUE_TITLE}
{GIST_CONTEXT}
{SOURCE_PR_HINT_CONTEXT}
"
)
```

**`{GIST_CONTEXT}` generation**: For each issue being dispatched, build the context block. **Prefer the deconflicted `FORGE:SYNTHESIS_BRIEF` (from Phase 2.5) when one exists** — it is a per-issue, already-reconciled brief that carries only the arbitration decisions and sibling investigation Gists relevant to *this* issue. Injecting it instead of the full aggregated milestone-index gist means the agent does not re-arbitrate the same contradictions (less token spend, less nondeterminism). Only when Phase 2.5 did not run (0/1 investigations — no brief exists) does this fall back to the raw parent-investigation + milestone-index gist behavior. <!-- Added: forge#1192 -->

```bash
# Build GIST_CONTEXT for an issue
GIST_CONTEXT=""

# Preferred path: a deconflicted per-issue synthesis brief from Phase 2.5.
SYNTHESIS_BRIEF=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/{NUMBER}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains("<!-- FORGE:SYNTHESIS_BRIEF -->"))] | last | .body // ""' 2>/dev/null)

if [ -n "$SYNTHESIS_BRIEF" ]; then
  # Phase 2.5 ran and reconciled competing recommendations for this issue.
  # Inject the deconflicted brief INSTEAD of the raw milestone-index gist dump.
  GIST_CONTEXT="
**RECONCILED CONTEXT (orchestrate Phase 2.5 synthesis brief)**: Competing investigation recommendations affecting this issue have already been reconciled. Use this deconflicted brief as your primary cross-investigation context — do NOT independently re-arbitrate the underlying investigations.
${SYNTHESIS_BRIEF}"
else
  # Fallback: Phase 2.5 did not run (0/1 investigations). Use the raw gist behavior.
  # Markdown emphasis markers (**bold**, __bold__, *italic*) are stripped before matching,
  # since sub-issue bodies commonly render the label as "**Parent**: #NNN" and the bare
  # label alternation below would otherwise fail to match past the emphasis characters.
  PARENT_INV=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} -R {GH_REPO} --json body --jq '.body' \
    | sed -E 's/[*_]+//g' \
    | grep -oP '(?i)parent[: ]*#\K\d+|spawned from[: ]*#\K\d+' | head -1)

  if [ -n "$PARENT_INV" ] && [ -n "${INVESTIGATION_GISTS[$PARENT_INV]:-}" ]; then
    GIST_CONTEXT="
**CONTEXT FROM PRIOR INVESTIGATION**: Investigation #${PARENT_INV} produced Knowledge Gist(s) with findings relevant to this issue:
$(echo "${INVESTIGATION_GISTS[$PARENT_INV]}" | while IFS= read -r url; do echo "- ${url}"; done)
Fetch the Gist content during the context-gathering phase for implementation guidance."
  fi

  # Include milestone index URL if available (from Step 2C.5)
  if [ -n "$MILESTONE_INDEX_URL" ]; then
    GIST_CONTEXT="${GIST_CONTEXT}

**MILESTONE KNOWLEDGE INDEX**: All investigation findings for this milestone are aggregated in a single index Gist:
- ${MILESTONE_INDEX_URL}
The context-gathering phase can fetch this index to discover all investigation Gists for the milestone."
  fi
fi
```

If `GIST_CONTEXT` is empty (no synthesis brief, no parent investigation, and no milestone index found), the variable resolves to a blank line in the template — no impact on the agent prompt. <!-- Updated: forge#341, forge#1192 -->

**`{SOURCE_PR_HINT_CONTEXT}` generation** <!-- Added: forge#2351 -->: For each issue being dispatched, thread the source-PR `likely-moot` triage hint computed by `phase-1-resolve.md`'s "Source-PR Triage Hint" step (`ISSUE_LIKELY_MOOT[$NUM]`, `ISSUE_SOURCE_PR[$NUM]`, `ISSUE_SOURCE_PR_STATE[$NUM]` — Phase 1 output, not re-derived here) into the dispatched agent's initial context, framed explicitly as a starting point to verify, never as a conclusion:

```bash
# Build SOURCE_PR_HINT_CONTEXT for an issue — reads Phase 1's ISSUE_LIKELY_MOOT[]/ISSUE_SOURCE_PR[]/
# ISSUE_SOURCE_PR_STATE[] arrays (populated once in phase-1-resolve.md's pre-flight step).
SOURCE_PR_HINT_CONTEXT=""
if [ "${ISSUE_LIKELY_MOOT[{NUMBER}]:-unknown}" = "yes" ]; then
  SOURCE_PR_HINT_CONTEXT="
**SOURCE-PR TRIAGE HINT (non-binding — verify, do not assume)**: This finding cites source PR #${ISSUE_SOURCE_PR[{NUMBER}]}, which closed WITHOUT merging (state: ${ISSUE_SOURCE_PR_STATE[{NUMBER}]}). This is a hint to check FIRST during investigation, not a verdict — do NOT conclude INVALID on this basis alone. Two outcomes are both possible and have both occurred in production: (a) the flagged change genuinely never landed by any route (verify with \`git log -S\`/\`git merge-base --is-ancestor\` against the target branch) — if so, this supports an INVALID verdict with evidence; (b) the flagged change reached the target branch anyway via a DIFFERENT, independently-merged PR — if so, this finding is still valid and must be investigated and resolved normally, exactly like #2346 (source PR #2337 closed unmerged, but the code landed via independently-merged PR #2261, commit 90376f5 — #2346 correctly ended at needs-human, not invalid). Reach your own evidence-based verdict; this hint only tells you where to look first."
fi
```

If `ISSUE_LIKELY_MOOT[{NUMBER}]` is `unknown` or absent (no `**Source**: PR #{N}` citation found, source PR still open, source PR merged, or the lookup failed), `SOURCE_PR_HINT_CONTEXT` stays empty and resolves to a blank line in the template — no impact on the agent prompt, identical to the `GIST_CONTEXT` empty-case behavior above.

**Claims board context injection** <!-- Added: forge#1736 -->: When a coordination issue exists for this batch (`FORGE_COORD_ISSUE` is set), append the claims board URL and the active-claims check instruction to the agent's context. This enables each `/work-on` agent to post its `FORGE:CLAIM` on build start.

```bash
# Inject coordination issue URL if claims board was created in Step 3D.1
if [ -n "${FORGE_COORD_ISSUE:-}" ]; then
  GIST_CONTEXT="${GIST_CONTEXT}

**ORCHESTRATION CLAIMS BOARD**: This agent is running under an orchestration batch.
Claims board issue URL: ${FORGE_COORD_ISSUE}

On build start (Phase B2 / Phase 3C of /work-on), post a FORGE:CLAIM annotation on the
coordination issue above. Required fields:
  Holder: ##{NUMBER} / batch-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S)
  Files: (list of files from your FORGE:CONTRACT deliverables table, one per line)
  Interfaces: (public function/type signatures you will modify or that callers must preserve)
  TTL: terminal state of Holder issue ##{NUMBER}

On reaching terminal state (workflow:merged, workflow:invalid, needs-human, or workflow:awaiting-merge), post
<!-- FORGE:CLAIM_RELEASED --> on the coordination issue to release your claim.

Set FORGE_COORD_ISSUE=${FORGE_COORD_ISSUE} in your environment so /work-on phases can read it."
fi
```

**Hot-copy CONTRACT context** (extends `{GIST_CONTEXT}` for milestone-lane issues where the parent issue already carries a `FORGE:CONTRACT` annotation): <!-- Added: forge#1277 -->

When a DAG node issue was spawned from a decomposition (parent issue has `workflow:decomposed` label and the child issue body references `**Parent**: #NNN`), the parent issue may already have a `FORGE:CONTRACT` annotation that was posted before decomposition. Inject a scoped excerpt into the child's prompt so the child does not re-fetch it.

```bash
# Hot-copy: inject parent CONTRACT annotation excerpt into GIST_CONTEXT (milestone lane only)
PARENT_NUM=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} -R {GH_REPO} --json body --jq '.body' \
  | grep -oP '(?i)\*\*Parent\*\*[: ]*#\K\d+' | head -1)

if [ -n "$PARENT_NUM" ]; then
  PARENT_CONTRACT=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/${PARENT_NUM}/comments \
    --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains("<!-- FORGE:CONTRACT -->"))] | last | .body // ""' 2>/dev/null \
    | head -40)  # Scope: first 40 lines — Proposed Approach + Deliverables table only

  if [ -n "$PARENT_CONTRACT" ]; then
    GIST_CONTEXT="${GIST_CONTEXT}

**HOT COPY — PARENT FORGE:CONTRACT** (from parent issue #${PARENT_NUM}; do not re-fetch — durable record is on that issue):
${PARENT_CONTRACT}"
  fi
fi
```

If the issue has no parent reference, or the parent has no `FORGE:CONTRACT` annotation, this block produces no output and `GIST_CONTEXT` is unchanged. The hot-copy is an optimization — the durable annotation on the parent issue remains the authoritative record for compaction recovery.

**Same-file current-state brief injection** <!-- Added: forge#1860 --> — a separate, parallel mechanism to the `FORGE:SYNTHESIS_BRIEF` handling above: it does not replace or interact with Phase 2.5 investigation→implementation forwarding. When this issue was dispatched because a Layer 1/2/3 structural predecessor edge just resolved, Step 4B's core streaming dispatch loop has already populated `SAME_FILE_BRIEF[{NUMBER}]` with a short excerpt of what each such predecessor changed in the shared file/directory/module. Append it here:

```bash
# Append same-file/directory/shared-module briefs from resolved structural-edge predecessors.
if [ -n "${SAME_FILE_BRIEF[{NUMBER}]:-}" ]; then
  GIST_CONTEXT="${GIST_CONTEXT}

**SAME-FILE STATE BRIEF (structural DAG predecessor)**: One or more predecessors in this batch were serialized against you because they touch the same file/directory/module (Step 3C Layer 1/2/3 — not an explicit \`Depends on\`). Here is what they just changed — use this as your starting understanding of the file's current state; do not re-investigate it cold:
${SAME_FILE_BRIEF[{NUMBER}]}"
fi
```

This block is a no-op — `GIST_CONTEXT` resolves exactly as before — whenever `SAME_FILE_BRIEF[{NUMBER}]` is unset: the issue had no predecessors, its only predecessors were explicit-dependency/DATABASE-chain/Layer 4/Layer 5 edges (none of which populate `SAME_FILE_BRIEF`), or the orchestrator session was compacted and restarted between Phase 3 and this dispatch (in which case `EDGE_KIND`/`EDGE_FILES`/`SAME_FILE_BRIEF` are in-memory-only and are not reconstructed by the wake/compaction recovery in `phase-3-dependency.md` — the dispatched agent simply proceeds without the brief, exactly as it would have before this mechanism existed).

**Capture agent IDs after the batch spawn (MANDATORY)**: Each `Agent(...)` call returns an agent ID. Store each returned ID in `AGENT_ISSUE_MAP` keyed by issue number. This map is the only way to resume a stalled agent by ID in Steps 4B and 4B.5:

```
# After the single-message batch spawn, capture each returned ID:
AGENT_ISSUE_MAP[{NUMBER}] = <agent_id returned by Agent()>
```

`AGENT_ISSUE_MAP` starts empty and accumulates entries as agents are spawned. For parallel dispatch (all Agent() calls in one message), capture the returned IDs from the batch response — one entry per issue — before entering Step 4B's monitoring loop. Without this capture, `resume=` calls in Steps 4B and 4B.5 will have no agent ID to reference and the resume will fail. <!-- Added: forge#1083 -->

**Launch only up to the concurrency cap** (forge#1912) — never put more than `dispatch_headroom` (`MAX_CONCURRENT - ACTIVE_DISPATCH_COUNT`, from Step 4A-pre.0.2) Agent tool calls into a single message. Use `run_in_background=true` so the dispatched agents execute in parallel with each other, within the cap.

```bash
# Compute this dispatch batch (forge#1912): merge any previously-deferred concurrency
# issues (oldest first, for fairness) with the current ready set, then take only as many
# as headroom allows. The remainder is re-queued, not dropped.
HEADROOM=$(dispatch_headroom)
CANDIDATES=("${DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES[@]}" {ready_issue_numbers})
DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES=()

DISPATCH_NOW=()
for NUM in "${CANDIDATES[@]}"; do
  if [ "${#DISPATCH_NOW[@]}" -lt "$HEADROOM" ]; then
    DISPATCH_NOW+=("$NUM")
  else
    DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES+=("$NUM")
  fi
done

if [ "${#DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "CONCURRENCY DEFER: ${#DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES[@]} ready issue(s) held back — ${ACTIVE_DISPATCH_COUNT}/${MAX_CONCURRENT} already in flight. Will dispatch as slots free up: ${DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES[*]}"
fi
echo "Dispatching ${#DISPATCH_NOW[@]} issue(s) this message (headroom was ${HEADROOM})"
```

Immediately before every Claude `Agent()` or OpenCode `task()` call, run `claim_conflicts_with_live_holder "{NUM}"`; when it returns success, append the issue to `DEFERRED_CLAIM_ISSUES[]` and do not make that call. Spawn `Agent()` for every remaining issue in `DISPATCH_NOW` (not the raw ready set) using the template above. After the batch spawn, increment `ACTIVE_DISPATCH_COUNT` by the number actually dispatched — this happens in addition to, not instead of, capturing each returned agent ID into `AGENT_ISSUE_MAP` above.

If `DISPATCH_NOW` is empty (headroom is 0), do not spawn any agents this cycle — wait for the next `agent_completed` notification, which frees a slot and re-triggers this dispatch computation (Step 4B).

### Step 4B: Monitor completions and dispatch newly ready issues

You will be automatically notified when each background agent completes — or, for an engine-first dispatch (Step 4A, `FORGEDOCK_AVAILABLE=true`), when a backgrounded `Bash(run_in_background=true, command="forgedock run-issue ...")` call completes. In OpenCode, a native background `task` first returns a `state="running"` result and later injects a synthetic `<task id="..." state="completed">` or `state="error"` result into this same parent session. The later result is the completion event; the initial running result is not completion. Both Claude notifications and OpenCode task-result events must trigger the same per-issue handling immediately. **Do NOT use `sleep` loops, wait for the slowest sibling, or poll before processing an event.** When one arrives, look up which issue it belongs to — `AGENT_ISSUE_MAP` for a Claude `agent_completed` notification, `ENGINE_DISPATCH_MAP` for a background-Bash notification, or `OPENCODE_DISPATCH_MAP` for an OpenCode task result — and immediately process it exactly the same way regardless of which map resolved it; every check below (`classify_predecessor_state()`, dependent dispatch, stall/staging checks) keys off GitHub labels/state, not which dispatch mechanism produced them. For an OpenCode completion, append this terminal record before releasing capacity:

```bash
if [ "${DRY_RUN:-false}" = "false" ]; then
  gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "<!-- FORGE:DISPATCH -->
\`\`\`json
{\"runtime\":\"opencode\",\"child_session_id\":\"{TASK_ID}\",\"attempt\":${ATTEMPT},\"state\":\"{completed|error}\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}
\`\`\`"
fi
```

**Fallback**: if a runtime ever fails to deliver a background completion notification, read the latest `FORGE:DISPATCH` record and use the documented label-state recovery path, but do not convert the normal OpenCode path to foreground tasks or a wave barrier.

For an OpenCode completion, retain `OPENCODE_DISPATCH_MAP[{NUMBER}]` until the terminal `FORGE:DISPATCH` record above has been posted successfully. Then remove that map entry and release capacity. This makes a restart deterministic: a latest `running` record restores the task-to-issue association, while a latest `completed` or `error` record cannot release the same slot twice.

**Concurrency slot release (MANDATORY — first action on every completion)** <!-- Added: forge#1912 -->: The instant a completion notification arrives — `agent_completed`, a background-Bash completion, or an OpenCode `task` result with `state="completed"`/`state="error"` — decrement `ACTIVE_DISPATCH_COUNT` by 1 — a worker slot has just freed, regardless of what terminal state the issue ended up in. Do this before any stall-recovery/resume logic below. If that agent is then resumed or fallback-dispatched (item 2 below, or Step 4B.5's stall recovery) because it stalled mid-pipeline rather than truly finishing, re-increment `ACTIVE_DISPATCH_COUNT` when the `Agent(resume=...)` or a fresh OpenCode `task(background=true)` continuation is issued — either re-occupies a worker slot exactly like a fresh dispatch does. (Step 4B.5's TIME-BASED hang detector — an agent that never completes at all, as opposed to one that completes at `workflow:engine-error` — remains resume-specific and out of scope for this fix: an engine-dispatched issue that silently hangs still surfaces only via the standard stall-detection alert, and `forgedock resume-stalled` remains available as a separate manual/scripted recovery path for that case. The completion-triggered case — an engine-dispatched issue that DOES complete at `workflow:engine-error` with empty committed state — is still auto-fallen-back by item 2b below, fixed forge#2743.)

**Ordering requirement (MANDATORY — prevents transient over-cap)**: For every agent that completed in this notification batch, finish its terminal-state check and, if applicable, its resume re-increment (items 1-2 below) BEFORE computing `dispatch_headroom` for item 5's newly-ready-issue dispatch. Computing headroom before a to-be-resumed agent's re-increment would let a genuinely-still-running agent's freed slot be double-booked — once by a fresh dispatch, once by the resume itself — transiently exceeding `MAX_CONCURRENT`. Process every completed agent's items 1-2 to a decision (terminal vs. resumed) first; only then compute headroom once for the batch's item 5 dispatch.

**Successor dispatch latency is measured from `agent_completed`, not from orchestrator polling.** The moment you receive an `agent_completed` notification for issue N, that is t=0 for dispatching N's successors. Any successor whose predecessors are all now terminal MUST be dispatched in the same response that processes the notification — not after a poll cycle, not after a sleep. This is the design property that makes streaming DAG execution faster than wave-based execution. <!-- Added: forge#1251 -->

**Predecessor Classification (DONE / GATED / FAILED)** <!-- Added: forge#1812 --> — every check in this file that asks "is predecessor X resolved enough for its dependents to proceed" MUST classify X into exactly one of three states below — never a single binary terminal/non-terminal grep. Earlier versions of this file independently patched `grep -qE 'workflow:merged|workflow:invalid|needs-human|CLOSED'` in multiple places, and the copies drifted: the readiness check (this step) treated `needs-human` as done-enough-to-dispatch-through, while the failure handler (item 6 below) treated the identical label as a hard failure that skips dependents. Both cannot be right at once — `needs-human` means the predecessor's code is paused pending a human decision and is NOT yet in the base branch, so dispatching a dependent against it is unsafe, but permanently skipping the dependent is also wrong once the human resolves the block. The fix is a third state:

```bash
classify_predecessor_state() {
  local PRED="$1"
  local PRED_INFO
  # NOTE: the `workflow` array below deliberately also keeps `needs-human` — that label has NO
  # `workflow:` prefix (see bin/labels.json), so a bare `select(startswith("workflow:"))` would
  # drop it and the GATED branch's `needs-human` case would be dead code (forge#1812 primary case).
  PRED_INFO=$(gh issue view "$PRED" -R {GH_REPO} --json labels,state \
    --jq '{state: .state, workflow: [.labels[].name | select(startswith("workflow:") or . == "needs-human")]}' 2>/dev/null || echo '{}')
  local PRED_STATE PRED_LABELS
  PRED_STATE=$(echo "$PRED_INFO" | jq -r '.state // "OPEN"')
  PRED_LABELS=$(echo "$PRED_INFO" | jq -r '.workflow[]?' 2>/dev/null)

  if echo "$PRED_LABELS" | grep -qx "workflow:invalid"; then
    echo "FAILED"
  elif echo "$PRED_LABELS" | grep -qx "workflow:merged"; then
    echo "DONE"
  elif echo "$PRED_LABELS" | grep -qxE "needs-human|workflow:awaiting-merge"; then
    echo "GATED"
  elif echo "$PRED_LABELS" | grep -qx "workflow:engine-error"; then
    # forge#2261: the engine/tool itself broke on this run (e.g. a fail-fast
    # CLI_BACKEND_FAILED, or an exhausted retry loop where the runner never
    # once succeeded) — this is NOT a human-judgment block, so it must NOT
    # classify GATED (that would wrongly track dependents as
    # blocked-on-human-merge, waiting on a merge decision nobody needs to
    # make). It is also not FAILED — the predecessor's content was never
    # actually judged bad, the tool just needs to be re-run. Classifying it
    # IN_PROGRESS means dependents simply keep waiting, exactly as if the
    # predecessor were still mid-pipeline — which is accurate, since the
    # stall-detection step below (item 2) auto-resumes/retries a completed
    # agent run that ends in workflow:engine-error, same as any other stall.
    # Fixed forge#2743: item 2's sub-case 2b is what actually fulfills this for
    # ENGINE_DISPATCH_MAP-tracked issues (fresh Agent-spawn fallback on empty
    # committed state) — 2a's Agent(resume=...) alone cannot reach them, since
    # they were never in AGENT_ISSUE_MAP.
    echo "IN_PROGRESS"
  elif [ "$PRED_STATE" = "CLOSED" ]; then
    # Closed with no workflow:invalid/merged label (e.g. closed-not-planned) — treat as DONE,
    # not a new deadlock state; there is no pending code for dependents to wait on.
    echo "DONE"
  else
    echo "IN_PROGRESS"
  fi
}
```

- **DONE** — predecessor's code is in the base branch (`workflow:merged`), or the predecessor is closed with no pending code. Safe for dependents to dispatch.
- **GATED** — predecessor is paused pending a human decision (`needs-human`) or pending only a human merge click (`workflow:awaiting-merge`). Its code is NOT yet in the base branch. Dependents are neither dispatched nor skipped — they move to the `blocked-on-human-merge` tracked state (item 6.5 below).
- **FAILED** — predecessor was closed as `workflow:invalid`, or the agent explicitly reported a build/test error. Dependents are marked "skipped — dependency failed" (item 6 below) — unchanged from prior behavior.
- **IN_PROGRESS** — predecessor is still mid-pipeline (`investigating`/`ready-to-build`/`building`/`in-review`), or terminated `workflow:engine-error` (forge#2261 — an engine/tool failure, not a human-judgment block or a genuine content failure; treated as still-in-flight since stall-detection auto-resumes it). Dependent simply continues waiting; no special tracking needed.

A GATED predecessor whose PR later merges reclassifies to DONE the next time `classify_predecessor_state` runs (its label flips to `workflow:merged`) — this is exactly what the merge-triggered wake check (item 6.6 below) relies on.

**File-overlap edge re-verification** <!-- Added: forge#1904 --> — `classify_predecessor_state()` answers "is the predecessor resolved enough to proceed," but it says nothing about whether a specific Layer 1/2/3 file-overlap edge (`EDGE_KIND`/`EDGE_FILES`, tagged in `phase-3-dependency.md` Step 3C/3D) was ever real. Both were built from a **pre-build guess** — the predecessor's `FORGE:INVESTIGATOR` "Affected Files" list, or a raw issue-body parse if no investigation existed yet. Once a predecessor reaches FAILED, GATED, **or DONE**, that guess must be checked against ground truth (the predecessor's actual PR diff, or the absence of any PR) before the edge is allowed to keep blocking a dependent or to inject a same-file brief. Without this, a predecessor that reaches `needs-human` or `workflow:invalid` having never touched the guessed shared file (or never opened a PR at all) leaves its dependents gated/skipped on a conflict that never existed — and on the happy path, an over-serialized chain is never reconciled at all and stays serialized for its entire life (forge#2848).

```bash
verify_file_overlap_edge() {
  local PRED="$1"

  # hand-rolled grep against comment/PR body text).
  #
  # Exclude CLOSED-unmerged PRs (same precedent as the milestone-base-consistency check
  # elsewhere in this file: "a closed-but-not-merged PR is a superseded/abandoned routing

  # (needs-human/workflow:awaiting-merge) predecessor this can only ever surface an OPEN PR —
  # a MERGED PR would already classify the predecessor DONE, not FAILED/GATED — so this filter

  # abandoned PR whose branch may since have been force-deleted (e.g. by /cleanup).
  #
  # forge#2848 — the DONE call site widens what this can surface: for a DONE predecessor

```

**Call sites**: item 6 (FAILED handling, below), item 6.5 (GATED handling, below), and the DONE arm of the core streaming dispatch loop (below — see "DONE-path edge re-verification") all call this helper — once per `EDGE_KIND`-tagged predecessor edge — before cascading a skip or tracking `blocked-on-human-merge`. `phase-3-dependency.md`'s wake/compaction reconstruction block calls the identical logic (mirrored verbatim, not re-derived) for the case where the predecessor resolves after the orchestrator session has already ended — see that file's "Orchestrator state reconstruction on wake / after compaction" section. This mirroring is deliberate: keeping the check in exactly one function definition, called (not reimplemented) from both files, avoids the same drift class forge#1812 had to fix once already for DONE/GATED/FAILED classification itself.

**Recursive cascade note (item 6 only)**: when a dependent `DEP` is itself marked "skipped — dependency failed" (edge confirmed `KEEP`, not dropped), `DEP` becomes the new FAILED anchor for its own direct dependents — re-run this same `verify_file_overlap_edge` check at that next hop too, rather than assuming every transitive descendant is unconditionally skipped. A grandchild dependent whose only path to the failure runs through a spurious (droppable) edge one hop down must not be skipped just because its parent was.

**Never called from**: the `IN_PROGRESS` branch (nothing to re-verify yet — the predecessor hasn't concluded).

**DONE-path edge re-verification** <!-- Added: forge#2848 --> — the DONE branch *does* call this helper, and it is the only call site that fires on the happy path. Be precise about what it buys, because the obvious reading is wrong:

**It does NOT release the dependent.** A DONE predecessor already satisfies its own edge — see the `;; # satisfied` arm and the `ALL_PREDS_DONE` gate below. Dropping an edge whose predecessor is already DONE releases nobody, so re-verification alone cannot re-parallelize anything. What it actually buys is two things:

1. **Suppressing a spurious same-file brief.** The DONE arm spends up to three `gh api` comment fetches per edge and then injects a `SAME_FILE_BRIEF` excerpt into the dependent's dispatch context. When the predecessor's real diff never touched the guessed file, that brief is not merely wasted tokens — it actively misleads the agent into coordinating on a file the predecessor never wrote. Verifying **before** those fetches skips all three calls and the brief.
2. **Producing the disproof signal that enables re-derivation.** This is the part that actually re-parallelizes. A `DROP` on a `body-fallback`-provenance edge is evidence that the whole cohort's extraction is suspect: the first real diff has just contradicted the guess the chain was built on. By that point the still-blocked descendants have been investigated and possibly contracted, so re-running Layer 1 extraction against those now-higher-provenance sources and dropping edges that no longer hold is what collapses the chain. This is the step an operator performed by hand in the batch that motivated forge#2848; wiring it here makes it automatic.

**Core streaming dispatch loop**: After processing each agent completion, check the DAG for newly unblocked issues. If any issue now has all predecessors classified `DONE`, dispatch it immediately (run Steps 4A.pre.0, 4A.pre, and 4A for the newly ready issues). This is the key difference from the wave model — issues dispatch as soon as their specific predecessors complete, not after an entire group finishes.

```bash
# After each agent completion, check for newly ready issues:
READINESS_RESCAN=true
while [ "$READINESS_RESCAN" = "true" ]; do
  # Re-derivation can remove an unresolved predecessor from an issue that this
  # pass has already visited. Repeat the scan so it can dispatch this cycle.

```

**CRITICAL — Stall detection and recovery**: Background agents sometimes stop mid-pipeline (`stop_reason=end_turn`) after completing a sub-phase (e.g., investigation completes but build never starts). This causes the agent to "complete" from the Agent tool's perspective even though the `/work-on` pipeline is only partially done. When you receive a completion notification:

1. **Check if the agent completed the FULL pipeline** — not just one phase:
   ```bash
   # Check final workflow state — workflow:merged, workflow:invalid, needs-human, and
   # workflow:awaiting-merge all mean this agent's own /work-on run has stopped (the last
   # two are human-gated pauses, not completions). See Predecessor Classification above for
   # how the DAG's readiness/failure logic treats these same labels differently from "this
   # agent is done running."
   FINAL_STATE=$(gh issue view $NUM -R {GH_REPO} --json labels,state --jq '{state: .state, workflow: [.labels[].name | select(startswith("workflow:"))]}')
   echo "#{NUM}: $FINAL_STATE"
   ```

2. **If the issue is NOT in a terminal-for-this-agent state** (`workflow:merged`, `workflow:invalid`, `needs-human`, or `workflow:awaiting-merge`), the agent stalled mid-pipeline. **Resume it immediately**. `workflow:engine-error` (forge#2261 — `bin/engine.mjs`'s headless engine terminating on an engine/tool-level failure rather than a genuine human-judgment block) is deliberately excluded from the terminal-for-this-agent set: a completed agent run ending there is treated exactly like any other stall and auto-resumed/retried here, up to the resume-cap in item 3 below — no human decision is pending, so there is nothing to gate on.

   **Two distinct resume mechanisms, dispatched by which map resolved the completion (fixed forge#2743)** — `AGENT_ISSUE_MAP`-resolved completions (Agent-spawn path) and `ENGINE_DISPATCH_MAP`-resolved completions (engine-first path) hit `workflow:engine-error` for structurally different reasons and need different recovery:

   **2a. Agent-spawn-dispatched issue (`AGENT_ISSUE_MAP[{NUMBER}]` set)** — unchanged from prior behavior. Resume the same agent in place:
   ```
   Agent(
     resume=AGENT_ISSUE_MAP[{NUMBER}],
     description="Resume #{NUMBER} pipeline",
     run_in_background=true,
     prompt="The previous /work-on invocation stopped before completing the full pipeline. The issue is currently at {CURRENT_WORKFLOW_STATE}. Continue — invoke Skill(skill='work-on', args='{NUMBER} --under-orchestration') to resume the routing loop from the current state. /work-on will re-read GitHub state and pick up where it left off."
   )
   ```

   **2b. Engine-first-dispatched issue (`ENGINE_DISPATCH_MAP[{NUMBER}]` set, no `AGENT_ISSUE_MAP` entry)** — `Agent(resume=...)` has nothing to resume here; the completed task was a backgrounded `Bash(command="forgedock run-issue ...")` call, not an `Agent()`. Re-issuing the identical `forgedock run-issue` command would just reproduce the same environmental failure. Instead, fall back to the Agent-spawn path for this ONE issue — but only when it is safe to do so:
   ```bash
   # Safety gate: only fall back when the engine run committed NOTHING — no branch, no PR, no
   # committed phases. Primary source: the `FORGE:STATE` HTML-comment block the engine already
   # mirrors onto the issue BODY on every phase transition (`bin/engine/state.mjs`/`projector.mjs`
   # — see phase-3-dependency.md "Engine mode (default)"), which carries `committed`/`branch`/`pr`
   # as real JSON — read it directly rather than screen-scraping terminal text:
   # NOTE (forge#2750 review fix): `bin/engine/state.mjs`'s `serializeState()` writes the block
   # as THREE separate lines — `<!-- FORGE:STATE`, the JSON payload, and `-->` — never all on one
   # line. A single-line `grep -oP '(?<=<!-- FORGE:STATE)[\s\S]*?(?=-->)'` NEVER matches this <!-- allowlist:portability — cited non-portable anti-pattern being replaced, not a command this spec runs -->
   # (GNU `grep -P` without `-z` operates per-line, not across newlines, regardless of `[\s\S]`)
   # — it always returns empty. Extract the block with a `sed` line-range instead, which handles
   # the real multi-line shape correctly:
   STATE_BLOCK=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json body --jq '.body' \

   **Resume ALL stalled agents in a single message** (parallel resume/fallback across 2a and 2b together). Do not wait between resumes. Each resume or fallback dispatch re-occupies a worker slot — increment `ACTIVE_DISPATCH_COUNT` by 1 per agent resumed/dispatched here (it was already decremented by the "Concurrency slot release" rule above when the stall was first observed as a completion). <!-- Added: forge#1912 -->

3. **Track resume cycles per agent.** If an agent has been resumed 2+ times and still hasn't reached a terminal state, report it as a failure — do not resume again.

4. **Post CLAIM_RELEASED on coordination issue** (when `FORGE_COORD_ISSUE` is set): <!-- Added: forge#1736 -->
   ```bash
   # After verifying terminal state for issue NUM, release its claim on the coordination issue
   if [ -n "${FORGE_COORD_ISSUE:-}" ]; then
     COORD_NUM=$(echo "$FORGE_COORD_ISSUE" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
     if [ -n "$COORD_NUM" ]; then
       gh issue comment "$COORD_NUM" -R {GH_REPO} --body "<!-- FORGE:CLAIM_RELEASED -->
**Holder**: #${NUM} — reached terminal state: ${FINAL_WORKFLOW_STATE}
**Released**: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" 2>/dev/null || true
       echo "CLAIM_RELEASED posted for #${NUM} on coordination issue #${COORD_NUM}"
     fi
   fi
   ```

   **Claims-board relaxation sweep** (run after posting CLAIM_RELEASED): When a claim is released, check all remaining Layer-2/4-serialized issue pairs. If the now-released Holder's claimed files were the *only* conflict reason for a still-blocked issue, and that blocked issue already has an active `FORGE:CLAIM` with a disjoint file set, the blocking edge MAY be relaxed (blocked issue becomes ready). <!-- Added: forge#1736 -->

   ```bash
   # After CLAIM_RELEASED for issue NUM:
   # Read all active FORGE:CLAIM annotations from coordination issue
   if [ -n "${FORGE_COORD_ISSUE:-}" ] && [ -n "${COORD_NUM:-}" ]; then
      ACTIVE_CLAIMS=$(read_active_claims "$COORD_NUM" 2>/dev/null || echo '[]')
     # For each still-blocked issue in a Layer-2/4 pair: check if its claim's file set
     # is disjoint from all remaining active claims. If so, mark it ready.
     # (Layer-1 and Layer-3 edges are never relaxed — this check is Layer-2/4 only.)
     for BLOCKED_NUM in {layer_2_4_blocked_issues}; do
       BLOCKED_CLAIM_FILES=$(echo "$ACTIVE_CLAIMS" \
         | jq -r --arg h "#${BLOCKED_NUM}" '.[] | select(.holder | startswith($h)) | .files' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
       if [ -n "$BLOCKED_CLAIM_FILES" ]; then
         # Compare file set with all other active claims — if disjoint, downgrade to ready
         echo "Claims-board relaxation: checking if #${BLOCKED_NUM} can be unblocked based on disjoint claims"
         # (Implementer: build a set-intersection check here using sorted file lists)
       fi
     done
   fi
   ```

5. **Record completed results**: Success (PR merged), Invalid (issue closed), Blocked (needs human), Awaiting-merge (`workflow:awaiting-merge` — remediated + re-reviewed to APPROVED after an earlier `needs-human` escalation; needs only a human merge, not diagnosis — keep distinct from Blocked in any status output, see item 8), or Error

5. **Check for newly unblocked issues** — run the DAG readiness check above. If any issues are now ready, run Steps 4A.pre.0 → 4A.pre → 4A for them. **Step 4A's own headroom computation is the cap** (forge#1912) — "batch all newly ready issues into a single dispatch message" means one message covers `DISPATCH_NOW` (ready issues that fit current headroom), not necessarily every newly-ready issue; any that don't fit go to `DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES` and retry on the next completion.

6. **Handle predecessor failures** — if a completed agent's issue classifies as `FAILED` (`workflow:invalid`, or an explicit build/test error — see Predecessor Classification above; `needs-human` and `workflow:awaiting-merge` are GATED, not FAILED — see item 6.5), check for dependent issues in the DAG.

   **Edge re-verification before cascading the skip** <!-- Added: forge#1904 -->: For each direct dependent `DEP` of the FAILED predecessor `PRED`, call `verify_file_overlap_edge "$PRED" "$DEP"` (defined above, alongside `classify_predecessor_state`). If the pair has no `EDGE_KIND` entry (explicit dependency, DATABASE chain, Layer 4/5 edge), the helper returns `KEEP` immediately and behavior is unchanged — cascade the skip as before. If the pair IS an `EDGE_KIND` edge (Layer 1/2/3) and the helper returns `DROP` (FAILED predecessor never opened a PR, or its PR's actual diff never touched the guessed shared file), do NOT cascade the skip through that specific predecessor for that specific dependent — remove `PRED` from `DEP`'s predecessor set instead. If `DEP` has other still-unresolved predecessors it continues waiting on them normally; if `PRED` was `DEP`'s only predecessor, `DEP` becomes immediately ready (run Steps 4A.pre.0 → 4A.pre → 4A for it this cycle). Only when the helper returns `KEEP` (or there is no `EDGE_KIND` entry) does the "skipped — dependency #{X} failed" outcome apply, unchanged from prior behavior.

   Report every dependent whose skip was avoided this way — e.g. "#{DEP} — predecessor #{PRED} failed but never touched the shared file(s); edge dropped, #{DEP} not skipped." For all remaining dependents (real `EDGE_KIND` overlap confirmed, or a non-`EDGE_KIND` edge type), mark them "skipped — dependency #{X} failed" and report them. Do NOT dispatch them.

6.4. **Auto-dispatch remediation against a `needs-human`-gated issue's own PR — runs unconditionally per completion, with or without dependents** <!-- Added: forge#1813, fixed: forge#2243 --> — item 6.5 below tracks the *dependents* of a `GATED` predecessor; this item handles the gated issue's own PR, which item 6.5/6.6 never re-drive on their own. **This check is bound directly to the issue that just completed — `PRED="$NUM"` (the same issue number carried from items 1-4 of this Step 4B sequence) — NOT to any `$PRED` produced by walking a dependent's predecessor list (item 5's readiness loop) or by item 6's FAILED-specific dependent-walk.** Run it for every completed agent, every cycle, regardless of whether that issue has any dependents in the DAG at all — a leaf issue (no dependents) is just as eligible as an issue that blocks others. Trigger condition: the completed issue classifies `GATED` **specifically via `needs-human`** — NOT `workflow:awaiting-merge`. That second state already means "remediated and re-reviewed to a clean verdict" (see forge#1810's guard) — dispatching remediation again would be redundant, not just wasteful, since there is nothing left to fix. A PR that reaches `workflow:awaiting-merge` now does so only when it targets `main` / the deploy gate (where `staging → main` is the genuine human gate and a human's merge click is required); a remediated-clean PR targeting a non-`main` base (`staging`, `milestone/*`) auto-lands to `workflow:merged` via remediate.md Phase M7's base-scoped auto-land bar (forge#2570) and never parks here. Either way this item's skip of `workflow:awaiting-merge` is unchanged.

   ```bash
   # Bind PRED to the issue that just completed — independent of item 5's dependent-walk loop
   # and item 6's FAILED-specific dependent-walk. This is the fix for forge#2243: a leaf issue
   # (no dependents) must still reach this check, since it never appears as a loop-bound $PRED
   # in either of those other contexts.
   PRED="$NUM"

   This satisfies #1809 Q2 (the orchestrator auto-dispatches remediation against the gated issue itself — the exact gap forge#1812's item 6.5/6.6 left open, since those items only ever track and wake *dependents*, never the gated PR's own remediation) — and closes forge#2243 (the gap that #1812's fix left open for *leaf* issues with no dependents: because this item's `$PRED` binding was never made explicit and self-contained, it was only ever reached while walking a dependent's predecessor list, so a `needs-human` issue that has no dependents never got remediation dispatched and its CHANGES-REQUESTED PR re-reviewed the same unchanged commit forever). The remediation agent's outcome is picked up on the **next** completion-monitoring cycle of this same Step 4B loop: if it lands (`workflow:merged`), item 6.6 below fires normally and wakes any `blocked-on-human-merge` dependents (if any exist — a leaf issue simply has none to wake); if it holds/re-escalates, the issue simply remains `GATED` and item 6.5 continues tracking its dependents (if any) unchanged.

6.5. **Handle predecessor gating** (`GATED` — `needs-human` or `workflow:awaiting-merge`) <!-- Added: forge#1812 --> — if a completed agent's issue classifies as `GATED`, its direct dependents are neither dispatched nor marked failed/skipped. For each direct dependent `DEP` of the gated predecessor `PRED`:

   **Edge re-verification gate (run FIRST, before any tracking)** <!-- Added: forge#1904 -->:
   ```bash
   EDGE_VERDICT=$(verify_file_overlap_edge "$PRED" "$DEP")
   if [ "$EDGE_VERDICT" = "DROP" ]; then
     echo "#{DEP} — predecessor #{PRED} is GATED but its EDGE_KIND file-overlap edge does not hold (no PR ever opened, or its actual diff never touched the guessed shared file(s)). Dropping the edge — not tracking #{DEP} as blocked-on-human-merge for this predecessor."
     # Remove PRED from DEP's predecessor set. If DEP has other unresolved predecessors it
     # keeps waiting on those normally. If PRED was DEP's only predecessor, DEP is immediately
     # ready — run Steps 4A.pre.0 → 4A.pre → 4A for it this cycle (same as any other newly
     # ready issue in the core streaming dispatch loop above).
     continue   # skip the tracking block below entirely for this (PRED, DEP) pair
   fi
   # EDGE_VERDICT = KEEP (real EDGE_KIND overlap confirmed, or no EDGE_KIND entry at all —
   # explicit dependency / DATABASE chain / Layer 4-5 edges always fall through to KEEP and
   # proceed with tracking exactly as before this fix).
   ```

   **Existing tracking logic (unchanged for the KEEP case)**:
   ```bash
   # Resolve PRED's open PR, if any, using the anchored search (forge#1634/#1646 precedent —
   # do NOT fall back to a bare-number search here; a stale unrelated PR would misattribute gating).
   GATING_PR=$(gh pr list -R {GH_REPO} --state open --search "\"Closes #${PRED}\" in:body" \
     --json number --jq '.[0].number // empty' 2>/dev/null || echo "")

     --jq '[.labels[].name | select(. == "needs-human" or . == "workflow:awaiting-merge")] | .[0] // "needs-human"' 2>/dev/null)

   # Self-heal the label if it hasn't been bootstrapped yet (same pattern as review-pr.md 6C —
   # colors match the canonical manifest bin/labels.json; --force makes this idempotent/cheap).
   gh label create "blocked-on-human-merge" --color "006B75" --description "Dependent of a gated (needs-human/awaiting-merge) predecessor. Managed by ForgeDock." --force -R {GH_REPO} 2>/dev/null

   # Idempotency: only post/label if not already tracked for this specific predecessor.
   # Anchor on the exact "**Gating predecessor**: #N" label with a word boundary —
   # a bare contains("#N") substring would false-match #50/#500 for predecessor #5. <!-- forge#1830 -->
   ALREADY_TRACKED=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/${DEP}/comments \
     --jq --arg prednum "${PRED}" '[.[] | select(.body | contains("FORGE:BLOCKED_ON_HUMAN_MERGE") and test("Gating predecessor\\*\\*: #" + $prednum + "\\b"))] | length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
   if [ "$ALREADY_TRACKED" -eq 0 ]; then
     gh issue comment "$DEP" -R {GH_REPO} --body "<!-- FORGE:BLOCKED_ON_HUMAN_MERGE -->
**Gating predecessor**: #${PRED} (state: \`${PRED_LABEL}\`${GATING_PR:+, open PR #${GATING_PR}})
**Status**: This issue is ready to dispatch as soon as #${PRED}'s gating PR merges. No action needed — the orchestrator (live session via item 6.6, or the next \`/orchestrate\` invocation via phase-3-dependency.md's wake reconstruction) will auto-dispatch it the moment #${PRED} reaches \`workflow:merged\`."
     gh issue edit "$DEP" -R {GH_REPO} --add-label "blocked-on-human-merge" 2>/dev/null || true
   fi
   ```
   Do NOT dispatch `DEP`. Do NOT mark it skipped — it remains visibly tracked as `blocked-on-human-merge` in the DAG, re-evaluated on the next completion event, stall-detection pass, or session wake.

6.6. **Merge-triggered wake for blocked-on-human-merge dependents** <!-- Added: forge#1812 --> — whenever a completed agent's issue classifies as `DONE` via `workflow:merged` (i.e. it just merged), check whether any other issue is tracked as blocked on it — this makes gated dependents dispatch the instant the gating PR merges, with no manual `/orchestrate` re-run required:
   ```bash
   WOKEN=$(gh issue list -R {GH_REPO} --state open --label "blocked-on-human-merge" --json number \
     --jq '.[].number' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
   for DEP in $WOKEN; do
     IS_GATED_BY_THIS=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/${DEP}/comments \
       --jq --arg prednum "${NUM}" '[.[] | select(.body | contains("FORGE:BLOCKED_ON_HUMAN_MERGE") and test("Gating predecessor\\*\\*: #" + $prednum + "\\b"))] | length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
     [ "$IS_GATED_BY_THIS" -gt 0 ] || continue
     # Idempotency: only dispatch if DEP hasn't already been dispatched by another path.
     DEP_ALREADY_DISPATCHED=$(gh issue view "$DEP" -R {GH_REPO} --json labels \
       --jq '[.labels[].name | select(startswith("workflow:"))] | length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
     if [ "$DEP_ALREADY_DISPATCHED" -eq 0 ]; then
       gh issue edit "$DEP" -R {GH_REPO} --remove-label "blocked-on-human-merge" 2>/dev/null || true
       gh issue comment "$DEP" -R {GH_REPO} --body "<!-- FORGE:UNBLOCKED -->
Gating predecessor #${NUM} reached \`workflow:merged\` — dispatching now. (Was tracked via a prior FORGE:BLOCKED_ON_HUMAN_MERGE comment.)"
       echo "#{DEP} unblocked by #{NUM} merge — dispatching immediately (Steps 4A.pre.0 → 4A.pre → 4A)."
       # Add DEP to the same-response dispatch batch
     fi
   done
   ```
   This satisfies the live-session case. For the case where the gating PR merges after the orchestrator session has already ended, the equivalent check runs in `phase-3-dependency.md`'s wake/compaction reconstruction on the next `/orchestrate` invocation — see that file's "Orchestrator state reconstruction on wake / after compaction" section.

6.7. **Human-gated idle/backpressure check** (`BATCH_FULLY_GATED`) <!-- Added: forge#1814 --> — run this after every completion cycle, once the per-issue classification above (items 5-6.6) has been applied for this cycle. It answers a different question than the paused-drain/blocked-on-human-merge tracking above: those items handle *individual* gated predecessors and their *direct* dependents; this check asks whether the **entire original batch** has now exhausted into human-gated states, which is the condition under which continuing to dispatch cascade-spawned review findings (Step 4C) produces net-negative churn — closing 1 issue while opening 2-4 more, with the real blockers (the GATED issues) unresolved:

   ```bash
   # BATCH_FULLY_GATED is computed over {all_batch_issue_numbers} — the ORIGINAL batch issues
   # this /orchestrate invocation was given, NOT cascade-spawned review-finding issues (those are
   # a separate, currently-unbounded-looking stream that this check exists to cap). Cascade
   # findings are excluded here because they are the SYMPTOM (Step 4C keeps producing them);
   # counting them as "still IN_PROGRESS" would make this check permanently false and defeat
   # its own purpose.
   ANY_ORIGINAL_IN_PROGRESS=false
   ANY_ORIGINAL_GATED=false
   for ORIG_NUM in {all_batch_issue_numbers}; do
     ORIG_STATE=$(classify_predecessor_state "$ORIG_NUM")
     case "$ORIG_STATE" in
       IN_PROGRESS) ANY_ORIGINAL_IN_PROGRESS=true ;;
       GATED) ANY_ORIGINAL_GATED=true ;;
       DONE|FAILED) ;;  # exhausted — no action
     esac
   done

   if [ "$ANY_ORIGINAL_IN_PROGRESS" = "false" ] && [ "$ANY_ORIGINAL_GATED" = "true" ]; then
     BATCH_FULLY_GATED=true
   else
     BATCH_FULLY_GATED=false
   fi
   ```

   - **`BATCH_FULLY_GATED=true`** requires BOTH: no original-batch issue is still `IN_PROGRESS` (i.e. nothing from the original scope will complete on its own without a human), AND at least one original-batch issue is `GATED` (`needs-human`/`workflow:awaiting-merge`, or a dependent already tracked `blocked-on-human-merge`). A batch that finishes entirely `DONE`/`FAILED` with zero `GATED` issues is NOT idle — it is simply complete; do not confuse the two.
   - **This is a live, recomputed flag, not a one-way latch.** Re-run it every completion cycle. If a gating PR merges (item 6.6 fires) and unblocks an original-batch dependent that becomes dispatchable again, `ANY_ORIGINAL_IN_PROGRESS` flips back to `true` on the next cycle and `BATCH_FULLY_GATED` flips back to `false` — normal dispatch resumes automatically. This is what prevents a permanent idle state and satisfies "no regression: when productive non-gated work remains, the orchestrator continues normally."
   - **Effect when true**: Step 4C's cascade-finding dispatch (the "For queued (non-deferred) findings" block) is suppressed — see the `BATCH_FULLY_GATED` check added there. The first time the flag flips from `false`/unset to `true` in a completion cycle, print the idle report below and stop actively dispatching new cascade work; the batch remains resumable exactly as item 6.6 and `phase-3-dependency.md`'s wake reconstruction already guarantee.

   **Idle report** (print once, the cycle `BATCH_FULLY_GATED` first becomes true):
   ```
   ⏸ Orchestrator Idle — Waiting on N Merge(s)

   The remaining batch is fully human-gated: every original issue is either merged/invalid, or
   blocked on a human decision/merge. No further autonomous progress is possible until one of the
   PRs below is merged. Newly-spawned review-finding issues are being deferred (not dispatched) so
   the open-issue count does not inflate while nothing productive can close.

   {reuse the Merge-Ready table computation from phase-6-report.md Step 6A.5 (MERGE_READY_PRS) and
    the Blocked-on-Merge table from Step 6A.6 (BLOCKED_ON_MERGE) — both already anchor their PR
    lookups on "Closes #N" in:body per forge#1634/#1646/#1822, so this reuses that logic verbatim
    rather than re-implementing a parallel PR-resolution path}

   Findings deferred (idle policy): {count of newly-queued findings deferred this cycle}
   ```

   This report is an interim, in-progress print — it does NOT replace the final consolidated report from Phase 6, which runs once the session actually ends or the next `/orchestrate` invocation picks the batch back up; see `phase-6-report.md` Step 6B for the corresponding "Orchestration Paused — Idle" header.

7. **Verify pipeline compliance** — for each truly completed issue, check that the agent used `/work-on`:
   ```bash
   LABELS=$(gh issue view $NUM -R {GH_REPO} --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name | select(startswith("workflow:"))] | length')
   COMMENTS=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/${NUM}/comments --jq '[.[] | select(.body | test("FORGE:INVESTIGATOR|FORGE:BUILDER"))] | length')
   if [ "$LABELS" -eq 0 ] || [ "$COMMENTS" -eq 0 ]; then
     echo "PIPELINE FAILURE: #{NUM} — agent bypassed /work-on (no labels or structured comments)"
   fi
   ```
   If an agent bypassed the pipeline, report it as a **failure** regardless of whether a PR exists.

8. **Post a status update** to the user after each agent reaches terminal state. Format is gated by `{NARRATION_MODE}` (resolved in `config.md` from `pipeline.narration`, default `"terse"`):

   **`terse` (default)** — one line per completion, no table, nothing repeated between completions:
   ```
   ✓ #{NUMBER} — {title} → PR #{PR} merged to {target}
   ✗ #{NUMBER} — {title} → {reason for failure}
   ⚠ #{NUMBER} — {title} → PR #{PR} blocked: review panel degraded (full fresh-session re-review required)
   ⚠ #{NUMBER} — {title} → PIPELINE BYPASS (no /work-on — PR invalid)
   ⏸ #{NUMBER} — {title} → PR #{PR} awaiting-merge (remediated + re-approved, `main`/deploy-gate base — human merge only, no diagnosis needed; non-`main` bases now auto-land to `workflow:merged` via remediate.md M7, forge#2570)
   🔗 #{NUMBER} — {title} → blocked-on-human-merge (gated by #{PRED}, will auto-dispatch on #{PRED} merge)
   ⏳ Progress: {completed}/{total} complete, {active} active, {blocked} blocked
   → Dispatched #{NEWLY_READY} (predecessor #{PRED} completed)
   ```

   **`verbose`** — same one-liners, plus a running per-completion recap table (title, PR, target, elapsed):
   ```
   ✓ #{NUMBER} — {title} → PR #{PR} merged to {target}

   | # | Title | PR | Target | Elapsed |
   |---|-------|----|--------|---------|
   {one row per issue completed so far in this batch}
   ```

   **This gate is cosmetic only** — it changes what prints to the terminal between completions, never which phases run or what gets committed. Step 6B's full tables (Implementation Results, Review-Spawned Issues, Batch Trajectory Analytics) always render once at the end regardless of `{NARRATION_MODE}`; terse mode just skips the redundant per-completion recap, since Step 6B already aggregates everything.

   `⏸` (awaiting-merge) is deliberately distinct from `⚠` (blocked/bypass) — do not collapse the
   two. `⚠` means the pipeline hit something it cannot resolve and a human must diagnose it;
   `⏸` means the PR already cleared re-review and only needs a merge click. `🔗` (blocked-on-human-merge,
   forge#1812) is distinct from both: it marks a DEPENDENT of a GATED predecessor (item 6.5) — the
   dependent itself has no problem at all, it is simply waiting on someone else's merge. See Phase 6's
   "Merge-Ready" report section (`phase-6-report.md` Step 6A.5/6B) for the batch-level rollup.

   Before printing a terminal status for a PR, inspect its labels. If it has `review-degraded`, print the dedicated blocked line above and retain the issue's `needs-human` state. Never report a degraded review as merged or awaiting-merge.

9. **Run staging integrity check** (from Step 4A-pre) if the completed agent merged a PR targeting staging.

**Termination condition**: All issues in the DAG have reached `DONE` or `FAILED` (merged, invalid, or skipped due to dependency failure) — OR are `blocked-on-human-merge` (item 6.5) with no further dispatchable work remaining in the batch. These two outcomes are reported differently: a batch where every issue is `DONE`/`FAILED` is a **clean drain**; a batch where one or more issues remain `blocked-on-human-merge` is a **paused drain** — the active dispatch loop stops (there is nothing left to do until a human merges a gating PR) but this MUST be reported as paused, not as fully complete (see `phase-6-report.md`'s `🔗 Blocked-on-Merge` section). `needs-human` predecessors with no open PR are neither — they remain GATED indefinitely until either a PR appears (dependent moves to blocked-on-human-merge) or the predecessor itself resolves; do not treat isolated `needs-human` issues with no dependents as blocking termination. When either drain condition is met, check whether deferred review-spawned findings exist (accumulated in `DEFERRED_FINDINGS` during Step 4C). If deferred findings exist → proceed to Step 4F (Completion Sweep). If no deferred findings → **call `release_orchestrator_lease()` (Step 4A-pre.-1)** — this is a clean/paused drain of this session's own dispatch loop, so the lease should not be left held for a now-idle session — then proceed to Phase 5. <!-- Added: forge#2627 -->

**Reminder — this is the normal-exit lease release, distinct from the interrupted-stop procedure**: whether the drain is clean or paused, this session is no longer actively dispatching, so its lease must be released here (or, for a paused drain, at minimum have its heartbeat refresh stop — see Step 4A-pre.-1). This complements, but does not replace, the **Stopping the orchestrator** procedure (Step 4A-pre.-0.5) which handles the abnormal case of a mid-dispatch interrupt.

**Relationship to `DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES` (forge#1912)**: A non-empty `DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES[]` never satisfies either termination condition above — it means dispatchable work exists but is temporarily held back by the concurrency cap, not that the DAG has stalled. Unlike `blocked-on-human-merge`, this is never reported as a "paused drain" requiring human action — it self-resolves automatically the moment any in-flight agent completes and frees a slot (Step 4A's `dispatch_headroom` recomputes every cycle). Only treat the DAG as drained once `DEFERRED_CONCURRENCY_ISSUES` is also empty.

**Relationship to `BATCH_FULLY_GATED` (item 6.7, forge#1814)**: A paused drain (above) describes the *original batch DAG* reaching a stable, non-progressing state. `BATCH_FULLY_GATED` is the mechanism that keeps that stable state from being masked by cascade churn — without it, Step 4C would keep dispatching new review-finding issues indefinitely (each with its own predecessors/dependents), so the DAG would never actually look "drained" even though the original batch's productive work stopped the moment the last non-gated issue completed. Once `BATCH_FULLY_GATED` is true, Step 4C stops adding new dispatchable work (rule 0 defers all newly-spawned findings), which lets the batch actually reach the paused-drain termination condition above instead of chasing an ever-growing cascade tail. Report this state using the idle report from item 6.7, not a plain "waiting for agents" message — the whole point is to make the pause visible and actionable (which PR(s) to merge), not silent.

**Anti-pattern — DO NOT DO THIS:**
- `sleep 60/120/180/300` loops to check status — you will be notified automatically
- Spawning separate "progress check" agents — they waste tokens and add noise
- Reading agent JSONL output files to check progress — use GitHub labels as the source of truth
- Polling the same status check repeatedly on a timer
- Waiting for a "batch" of completions before checking for newly ready issues — check after EVERY completion

### Step 4B.6: Predicate Re-Resolution (standing queries only)

<!-- Added: forge#2236 -->

**Purpose**: Phase 1 resolves `$ARGUMENTS` to an issue-number list exactly once (see `phase-1-resolve.md` "Predicate Persistence"). For a standing-query input (`ORIGINATING_QUERY_KIND == "query"` — everything except an explicit `#1 #2 #3` literal set), a new issue matching the same predicate can appear mid-run (a human files it, `/analytics` or `/signal-planner` create it, it gets added to the milestone) and is otherwise invisible to this batch until the operator re-invokes `/orchestrate` by hand. This step closes that gap for the *originating* issue set, distinct from Step 4C which folds in review-findings spawned *by* this batch's own agents.

**Skip entirely if** `ORIGINATING_QUERY_KIND == "literal"` (see `phase-1-resolve.md`) — an explicit issue-number list is the complete intent; there is nothing to re-resolve, ever.

**Trigger** (event-driven, same model as the rest of this file — no sleep/poll timer): run once per Step 4B completion cycle, immediately after the per-agent-completion handling above and before Step 4B.5's stall check.

```bash
# Gate on config + literal/query kind + round cap via bin/engine/resolve.mjs's
# shouldReResolve (mirrors admission.mjs's role for Step 4C's admission rules).
RERESOLVE_ENABLED=$(yq '.orchestration.reresolve.enabled // true' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo "true")
RERESOLVE_MAX_ROUNDS=$(yq '.orchestration.reresolve.max_rounds // "unbounded"' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo "unbounded")

node "{REPO_PATH}/bin/engine/orchestrate-canary.mjs" \
  "$ORIGINATING_QUERY_KIND" "$ORIGINATING_QUERY_PATTERN" \
  "$RERESOLVE_ENABLED" "$RERESOLVE_MAX_ROUNDS" "$RERESOLVE_ROUNDS_SO_FAR"
```

If the result's `reResolve` is `false` (off switch, or `RERESOLVE_ROUNDS_SO_FAR` has reached `max_rounds` — bounded termination per the issue's acceptance criteria), skip this step for the current cycle and log the reason. `RERESOLVE_ROUNDS_SO_FAR` starts at 0 for the batch and increments once per cycle this step actually runs (declare it alongside the other Step 4A.pre batch-scope accumulators — do not re-initialize per completion).

**Re-run the original query** using the exact same resolution logic Phase 1 used for `$ORIGINATING_QUERY_PATTERN`/`$ORIGINATING_QUERY_ARGS` (e.g. re-run the `gh issue list --milestone`/`--label`/`priority:P*` fetch from `phase-1-resolve.md`'s "Fetch the issues" section), applying the exact same eligibility filter Phase 1 applied (`phase-4-execution.md` cross-reference: `phase-1-resolve.md` "Filter out ineligible issues" — closed/`needs-human`/`workflow:decomposed`/`workflow:awaiting-merge` excluded, same as T0).

**Fold new matches through the existing admission path — never a bypass**:

```bash
node -e '
import("{REPO_PATH}/bin/engine/resolve.mjs").then(({ foldNewMatches }) => {
  const reResolved = JSON.parse(process.argv[1]);
  const processed = JSON.parse(process.argv[2]);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(foldNewMatches(reResolved, processed)));
}, () => process.exit(0));
' "$RERESOLVED_NUMBERS_JSON" "$ALL_BATCH_ISSUE_NUMBERS_JSON"
```

`newMatches` from `foldNewMatches` are candidate issues, not admitted ones. Each one MUST be dispatched through the exact same path a T0-resolved issue takes — DAG dependency analysis (`phase-3-dependency.md`), then Step 4A/4B's standard `dispatch_headroom`-gated dispatch — **not** through Step 4C's review-finding-specific `evaluateCascadeFinding` chain (that gate's rules, e.g. the comment/typo keyword heuristic, are shaped for cascade-spawned findings, not arbitrary re-resolved issues). This is the same non-bypass requirement Step 4C already satisfies for its own admission stream; this step must not become a second, ungated entry point into the DAG. Add every `newMatch` to `ALL_BATCH_ISSUE_NUMBERS` (so a later re-resolution round or Step 4C sees it as already processed) and to `SORTED_READY_SET`/the DAG exactly as Step 4A.pre.0 processes a T0-resolved issue.

**Reporting (mandatory — do not let this become an alert-only dead-code path, per forge#1832)**: track which issues were T0-resolved vs. admitted via re-resolution, and which round each entered in. Surface this distinction in the final report (`phase-6-report.md`) rather than only in a log line — a run whose predicate still matches unadmitted work at exit (round cap or config disabled mid-run) must say so explicitly, not report a silent clean drain.

**Multi-repo**: for `all-repos`/satellite-scoped queries (`next <N> all-repos`, `mcp:fast`, etc.), re-run the query against every repo the original resolution covered — not just the default repo.

### Step 4B.5: Time-Based Stall Detection

**Purpose**: Catches agents that have stopped responding WITHOUT exiting (e.g., rate-limited, context-frozen, or silently hung). The reactive check in Step 4B only fires on agent completion — this check catches agents that never complete at all.

**When to run** (NOT a sleep loop — two trigger points only):
1. On every background agent completion event (run BEFORE the terminal-state check in Step 4B)
2. Before posting any "waiting for agents..." status update to the user

**Do NOT poll on a timer. Do NOT use sleep. Run at these two trigger points only.**

**Read stall timeout from config**:
```bash
STALL_TIMEOUT=$(yq '.pipeline.stall_timeout_minutes // 15' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo 15)
```

**For each non-terminal agent in the current batch**:
```bash
for NUM in {active_issue_numbers}; do
  # Skip issues already in a terminal-for-this-agent state (merged/invalid/needs-human/awaiting-merge).
  # workflow:awaiting-merge MUST be included here (forge#1812) — otherwise the stall detector
  # re-escalates an already-remediated-and-re-approved PR back to needs-human after STALL_TIMEOUT,
  # silently collapsing the Awaiting-Merge/Blocked distinction forge#1811 introduced.
  TERMINAL=$(gh issue view $NUM -R {GH_REPO} --json labels \
    --jq '[.labels[].name | select(. == "workflow:merged" or . == "workflow:invalid" or . == "needs-human" or . == "workflow:awaiting-merge")] | length')
  [ "$TERMINAL" -gt 0 ] && continue

  # Get last activity timestamp — prefer last comment (catches FORGE:HEARTBEAT updates)
  LAST_ACTIVITY=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/${NUM}/comments \
    --jq '.[-1].updated_at // empty' 2>/dev/null)
  # Fall back to issue updated_at if no comments
  if [ -z "$LAST_ACTIVITY" ]; then

```

**Resume all stalled agents in a single message** (parallel). Use the same `Agent(resume=...)` pattern as Step 4B — do not wait between individual resumes.

**Track stall resume cycles separately** from completion-event resumes (Step 4B). If the same issue accumulates ≥ 2 `FORGE:STALL_DETECTED` comments AND still hasn't reached terminal state, do not resume again — the `needs-human` label is already set.

### Step 4C: Collect review-finding issues from completed agents

After each agent reaches a terminal state, check if its `/work-on` run spawned review-finding issues during the review phase. These are new work items that should be added to the dependency DAG and dispatched when ready.

**This step is the mid-run half of the run-spawned cascade mode** (`phase-1-resolve.md`
"Cascade / Review-Finding Resolution" — mode (a)). It scopes to `BATCH_T0` for the same reason
that resolve step does: this loop must only ever fold in `review-finding` issues *this batch's own
agents* produced, never the pre-existing open backlog. There is no whole-backlog-sweep mode here —
that mode only exists as the explicit, one-shot `--include-backlog` opt-in at Phase 1 resolve time
(a human directly asking for it); Step 4C runs autonomously on every completion cycle and must
never silently widen to the full backlog regardless of any flag, since nothing here is a
human-in-the-loop request. <!-- Added: forge#2628 -->

### Step 4C.0: Full-repository actionable-issue intake (`policy: all` only)

An operator-authorised `orchestration.cascade.policy: all` run must also check for newly-created
open issues that its own agents did not report and that lack `review-finding`. Run this sweep
after every five terminal completions, before the next dispatch cycle. It is not a cascade
replacement: Step 4C's `BATCH_T0` filter still governs review-finding recursion.

At batch start, seed `SEEN_OPEN_ISSUES` with the initial resolved issue set. On each sweep, list
the complete open set (`gh issue list --state open --limit 500 --json number,title,labels`), diff
it against `SEEN_OPEN_ISSUES`, then mark every returned number seen whether or not it is admitted.
For each newly-seen issue, add it to the normal Phase 3 DAG intake only when it has no terminal or
in-progress workflow label, `needs-human`, or `workflow:decomposed`; preserve its labels and
record why every excluded issue was skipped. Do not filter on `review-finding`, author, creation
time, or agent trajectory. This is how CI-created issues enter an all-policy run without silently
adopting pre-existing work in other policies.

```bash
if [ "$CASCADE_POLICY_NAME" = "all" ] && [ "$((TERMINAL_COMPLETIONS % 5))" -eq 0 ] && \
   [ "$TERMINAL_COMPLETIONS" -gt "$FULL_REPO_SWEEP_COUNT" ]; then
  FULL_REPO_SWEEP_COUNT=$TERMINAL_COMPLETIONS
  FULL_REPO_OPEN=$(gh issue list -R {GH_REPO} --state open --limit 500 --json number,title,labels)
  while IFS= read -r ISSUE; do
    NUM=$(echo "$ISSUE" | jq -r '.number')
    [ -n "${SEEN_OPEN_ISSUES[$NUM]:-}" ] && continue
    SEEN_OPEN_ISSUES[$NUM]=1
    LABELS=$(echo "$ISSUE" | jq -r '[.labels[].name] | join(",")')
    if echo "$LABELS" | grep -qE '(^|,)(workflow:(merged|invalid|awaiting-merge|building|in-review|decomposed)|needs-human)(,|$)'; then
      echo "Full-repo intake: #${NUM} seen but not admitted (terminal, in-progress, or human-gated)"
      continue
    fi
    FULL_REPO_INTAKE+=("$NUM")
    echo "Full-repo intake: admitted newly-seen actionable issue #${NUM}"
  done < <(echo "$FULL_REPO_OPEN" | jq -c '.[]')
  # Feed FULL_REPO_INTAKE through the existing Phase 3 extraction/DAG/claims gates.
fi
```

### Step 4C.1: Mechanical automated-alert deduplication (`policy: all` opt-in)

`orchestration.cascade.dedup_automated: true` permits a narrow exception to the normal
no-dedup rule for newly-seen automated alerts. Select one lowest-numbered canonical issue and
close another issue only when all of these are true: both authors are bot/app accounts; normalized
titles are identical; the generator identity is identical; the triggering condition is identical;
and the closing comment links the retained canonical issue. Never apply title similarity to a
human-authored report, or when generator/trigger provenance is absent or differs. The reference
predicate is `canDeduplicateAutomatedAlert()` in `bin/engine/admission.mjs`.

This opt-in handles mechanically identical alerts, not substantive bug adjudication. All other
possible duplicates remain separate and go through investigation.

```bash
# Method 1: Read TRAJECTORY comments from completed issues for "Finding issues" row
for NUM in {completed_issue_number}; do
  gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/${NUM}/comments \
    --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("FORGE:TRAJECTORY")) | .body' 2>/dev/null \
    | grep -oP 'Finding issues\s*\|\s*#?\K\d+[^|]*' | grep -oP '\d+' | sort -u
done

# Method 2 (fallback): Check for review-finding issues created since this batch started
# (BATCH_T0 — see Step 4A.pre above; reused from phase-1-resolve.md's Phase 1 capture, never
# a rolling "N hours ago" window). A rolling window can still admit pre-existing backlog
# issues that happen to have been created recently for reasons unrelated to this batch;
# anchoring to BATCH_T0 cannot, by construction — anything created before this batch began
# is excluded regardless of how recent it looks.
gh issue list -R {GH_REPO} --state open --search "label:review-finding created:>=${BATCH_T0}" --limit 20 \
  --json number,title,body,createdAt
```

**If review-finding issues were spawned:**

**Amplification accounting (MANDATORY, before cascade admission):** Count every finding created by this batch, including findings later deferred by any cascade rule. After each merged unit, compute `FINDINGS_SPAWNED / MERGED_UNITS`, append the value to `AMPLIFICATION_RATIO_HISTORY`, and print a convergence warning when the latest `CONVERGENCE_WINDOW` observations are all `>= 1.0`. A high ratio is a signal, not a failure: valuable deep review findings can legitimately raise it.

For each finding, extract its source PR from `**Source**: PR #N` and increment `FINDINGS_BY_SOURCE_PR[N]`. Classify it as a **same-lineage refinement** only when that source PR closes a `review-finding` issue and both that parent finding and this finding name the same affected file; otherwise classify it as **new surface**. Record the finding number in `REFINEMENT_FINDINGS` or `NEW_SURFACE_FINDINGS` respectively. If provenance or a file path cannot be established, classify as new surface conservatively; never suppress it as a refinement.

When `CASCADE_MAX_AMPLIFICATION` is not `off`, and the current ratio is greater than that ceiling, defer only newly discovered entries in `REFINEMENT_FINDINGS` with reason `amplification bound exceeded (same-lineage refinement)`. Add them to `DEFERRED_FINDINGS` and `DEFERRED_REASONS` so Step 4F re-evaluates them after the batch drains. Do not apply this bound to new-surface findings, P1/P2 findings, or any finding when the option is `off`.

```bash
# Run once for each completed issue before collecting its findings. Only merged
# units advance the denominator; invalid/skipped units do not imply delivered work.
if gh issue view "$NUM" -R {GH_REPO} --json labels \
  --jq '[.labels[].name | select(. == "workflow:merged")] | length' | grep -qx '1'; then
  MERGED_UNITS=$((MERGED_UNITS + 1))
  AMPLIFICATION_RATIO=$(awk "BEGIN { printf \"%.2f\", $FINDINGS_SPAWNED / $MERGED_UNITS }")
  AMPLIFICATION_RATIO_HISTORY+=("$AMPLIFICATION_RATIO")
  if [ "${#AMPLIFICATION_RATIO_HISTORY[@]}" -ge "$CONVERGENCE_WINDOW" ]; then
    RECENT_RATIOS=("${AMPLIFICATION_RATIO_HISTORY[@]: -$CONVERGENCE_WINDOW}")
    if printf '%s\n' "${RECENT_RATIOS[@]}" | awk '$1 < 1 { exit 1 }'; then
      echo "CONVERGENCE WARNING: amplification has remained >= 1.0 for ${CONVERGENCE_WINDOW} merged units (${AMPLIFICATION_RATIO} current). This can be productive review refinement, but the batch is not shrinking."
    fi
  fi
fi

```

**Cascade control (MANDATORY — run before folding findings into the DAG):**

For each spawned finding, determine whether it should be **executed** or **deferred**:

**Evaluation order** (first matching rule wins):
0. **Batch fully human-gated** (`BATCH_FULLY_GATED == true`, always defer, even for P1/P2) <!-- Added: forge#1814 -->: The original batch (see Step 4B item 6.7) has exhausted into DONE/FAILED/GATED with nothing left `IN_PROGRESS` — the real blockers are the GATED issues, not a lack of dispatchable findings. Dispatching a new review-finding here cannot produce net batch progress; it only inflates the open-issue count while the productive path waits on a human merge. Always defer, checked before generation and priority. Rationale: this is the idle/backpressure policy this issue adds — without it, rule 2 (below) unconditionally executes P1/P2 findings regardless of how gated the rest of the batch is, which is the root cause of the net-negative churn this policy exists to stop. **Configurable** via `orchestration.cascade.defer_on_batch_gated` (default `true`; `false` under `policy: all` — forge#2234).
1. **Generation ≥ 2** (always defer from individual autonomous dispatch, even for P1/P2, for mid-run cascade — see scope note below): Finding was spawned by an issue that was itself a review-finding. A P3 finding at or below the finite `orchestration.cascade.batch_max_generation` ceiling (default 2) is retained only as a candidate for the bounded P3 batch pass; it remains deferred if no batch forms. A formed batch records `FORGE:BATCH_MAX_GENERATION` and its generation-2+ members. No P1/P2, or finding above that ceiling, takes this exception. Rationale: gen-2+ individual cascade is theoretically unbounded — cap it here while permitting one auditable aggregation unit. **Scope**: this rule caps *autonomous* cascade — findings discovered and re-triaged automatically during an unattended run. It is not a cap on what a human can explicitly request. When an operator directly asks for cascade/review-finding work via `phase-1-resolve.md`'s dedicated `cascade`/`review-findings`/`findings` resolution (with `--include-deferred`/`--allow-gen2`, or the `orchestration.cascade.max_generation` config lever from #2234), those findings enter the DAG through Phase 1 resolution, not through this Step 4C mid-run triage. `batch_max_generation` is separate from `max_generation`, and remains finite even under `policy: all`. <!-- Added: forge#2231, forge#2849 -->
2. **Priority override** (P1 or P2 → always execute): If the finding is labeled P1 or P2, skip all remaining heuristics and execute. Rationale: high-priority findings must never be suppressed by keyword matching.
3. **Comment/typo heuristic** (P3 and below only): Finding title contains the word "comment" or "typo" (case-insensitive). These are 1-line cosmetic fixes that do not block other work. **Configurable** via `orchestration.cascade.keyword_heuristic` (default `true`; `false` under `policy: all` — forge#2234).
4. **P3 + same-file overlap**: Finding is labeled `P3` AND the file it targets overlaps with ANY file already in the current batch (active or queued in the DAG). Rationale: same-file P3 findings add predecessor edges that serialize agents — one finding per original issue increases wall-clock time with no proportional value. **Configurable** via `orchestration.cascade.p3_same_file_defer` (default `true`; `false` under `policy: all` — forge#2234).
5. **Per-batch token budget** (P3 and below only, applied AFTER surface-area batching below — see "Per-batch token budget gate") <!-- Added: forge#1858 -->: Once `BATCH_TOKEN_SPEND` would exceed `TOKEN_BUDGET`, additional P3-and-below units (an unclubbed finding, or an already-clubbed batch issue) defer rather than dispatch. This is NOT part of the per-finding rule 0-4 chain immediately below — it is a quantity gate applied to the POST-clubbing `QUEUED_FINDINGS` list, so a same-run surface-area batch issue (surface-area batching below) is charged once for the whole cluster, not once per member. P1/P2 are NEVER gated by it (they are excluded by rule 2 before reaching this gate, same as they are excluded from rules 3-4). **Configurable** via `orchestration.cascade.token_budget` (default `900000`, deprecated alias `pipeline.token_budget_per_batch`; `unlimited` under `policy: all` — forge#2234). This is a distinct, independent lever from rule 1's generation cap — "admit gen-2, stop at gen-3" (`max_generation: 3`) and "admit cascade until N tokens" (`token_budget: N`) can each be set without the other.

**Defer** (do NOT add to the DAG) if rules 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5 match.

**Execute** (add to the DAG) if:
- Rule 2 matches (P1 or P2) — AND rule 0 did not already match (rule 0 is checked first and overrides rule 2)
- None of the defer rules matched (generation 1, P3 with no file overlap, not a keyword match, batch not fully gated) AND rule 5's token budget still has headroom for this unit

**Before running the loop, build the batch file list (MANDATORY for Heuristic 3):**

Collect all file paths from every issue in the current batch — both completed and remaining queued issues in the DAG. This produces `ALL_BATCH_FILES`, a newline-separated list of file paths used by Heuristic 3 to test same-file overlap.

```bash
# Build ALL_BATCH_FILES: collect file paths from ALL batch issues (completed + queued)
# Use the same extraction pattern as Step 3C Layer 1

**Concern-level batching for queued P3 findings (MANDATORY check before dispatch):** <!-- Added: forge#1818 -->

Cascade-spawned findings collected within a single `/orchestrate` run must be reconsidered against the complete open, unbatched, undispatched candidate registry, not only `QUEUED_FINDINGS` from this completion cycle. At initial resolution and after every five completions (or whenever `DEFERRED_FINDINGS` reaches `MAX_CONCURRENT`), collect retained ungrouped candidates, new findings, and open batch membership; call `planP3BatchGroups()` with that registry and `batchExclusionReason()` danger-zone inputs. Execute returned `extensions` before new groups, retain `ungrouped` members for the next sweep, and record group kinds or exclusion predicates in the run summary. <!-- Added: forge#2858; extended: forge#2851, forge#2852 -->

The per-cycle `QUEUED_FINDINGS` loop below remains the action-creation mechanism, but it MUST consume the complete-sweep planner output rather than decide groups from its local same-file map. Do not dispatch a locally ungrouped member until the next periodic sweep has considered it against the retained candidate set.

```bash
# Group QUEUED_FINDINGS by exact affected file, reusing the SAME safety
# exclusions as phase-1-resolve.md. Both sites go through jq test() (Oniguruma)
# with identical patterns — NOT grep ERE — so the two batching checks cannot
# classify the same issue body differently. <!-- forge#1837 -->
# NOTE: SURFACE_BATCHED_FINDINGS and SURFACE_BATCH_COUNT are declared once in Step 4A.pre
# (batch scope) — do NOT re-initialize them here, this block runs per-agent-completion cycle.
# SURFACE_FILE_MEMBERS itself must NOT survive across cycles — `declare -A` on an
# already-declared associative array is a no-op on its existing contents in bash, so an
# explicit `unset` is required to actually clear it before each cycle repopulates it.

## Problem

Batch of P3 review findings in **${SAFE_SURFACE_AREA}** (same file), clustered mid-run by phase-4-execution.md to reduce per-finding pipeline overhead.

## Member Findings

<!-- FORGE:BATCH_MEMBERS -->
${MEMBER_LINES}<!-- /FORGE:BATCH_MEMBERS -->

**Maximum member generation**: ${BATCH_MEMBER_GENERATION}
<!-- FORGE:BATCH_MAX_GENERATION: ${BATCH_MEMBER_GENERATION} --> <!-- allowlist:check-spec-markers -->

**Generation >= 2 members admitted by bounded batching**:
${GEN2_MEMBER_LINES:-none}

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All member findings addressed or closed as false-positive
- [ ] Member issues auto-closed with reference to this batch PR on merge
- [ ] No security, billing, anti-bot, or auth paths touched (validated before batching)

Findings that remain ungrouped (fewer than 2 sharing a file in this collection round) stay individually queued below; they retain default-batchable eligibility and will be picked up by the next `/orchestrate` invocation's Phase 1 resolve if a same-file or leaf-directory cluster later forms across runs.

Charges ONE `TOKEN_ESTIMATE_PER_FINDING` per unit remaining in `QUEUED_FINDINGS` at this point — a same-run surface-area-clubbed batch issue counts as a single unit (its members were already replaced by the batch issue number above), never once per member. `TOKEN_BUDGET`, `TOKEN_ESTIMATE_PER_FINDING`, and `BATCH_TOKEN_SPEND` were declared in Step 4A.pre and persist across every Step 4C run this session performs — do NOT re-initialize `BATCH_TOKEN_SPEND` here. This is a DIFFERENT mechanism from the `--budget N` dollar-cost flag (economic scheduling, forge#1743, `should_dispatch()` in Step 4A-pre.0): that one is opt-in, dollar-denominated, and gates only the *original* `SORTED_READY_SET` dispatch loop — it is never consulted here.

```bash
TOKEN_BUDGET_DEFERRED_THIS_RUN=()

for FINDING_NUM in "${QUEUED_FINDINGS[@]}"; do
  # Schema-tolerant extraction (forge#2232) — same pattern as the Step 4C main loop above.
  # Defaults to P3 only when NEITHER label form is present (an empty labels match, not
  # merely a non-priority:P<n> label), so a bare-P3-labeled finding is read correctly
  # instead of falling through to this default.
  FINDING_PRIORITY=$(gh issue view "$FINDING_NUM" -R {GH_REPO} --json labels \
    --jq '(
      ([.labels[].name | select(test("^priority:P[0-9]+$"))] | .[0]) //
      ([.labels[].name | select(test("^P[0-9]+$"))] | .[0]) //
      "priority:P3"
    ) | ltrimstr("priority:")' 2>/dev/null || echo "P3")

  # P1/P2 are NEVER gated by the token budget — they were queued by rule 2 above
  # regardless of budget headroom; skip them here and leave them in QUEUED_FINDINGS.
  if [ "$FINDING_PRIORITY" = "P1" ] || [ "$FINDING_PRIORITY" = "P2" ]; then
    continue
  fi

  PROJECTED_TOKEN_SPEND=$((BATCH_TOKEN_SPEND + TOKEN_ESTIMATE_PER_FINDING))
  # TOKEN_BUDGET may be the "unlimited" sentinel (orchestration.cascade.token_budget /
  # policy: all) — never gate in that case, regardless of projected spend.
  if [ "$TOKEN_BUDGET" != "unlimited" ] && [ "$PROJECTED_TOKEN_SPEND" -gt "$TOKEN_BUDGET" ]; then
    TOKEN_DEFERRED+=("$FINDING_NUM")
    TOKEN_BUDGET_DEFERRED_THIS_RUN+=("$FINDING_NUM")
    DEFERRED_REASONS[$FINDING_NUM]="token budget exceeded (est. ${TOKEN_ESTIMATE_PER_FINDING} tokens would push batch spend to ${PROJECTED_TOKEN_SPEND} > ceiling ${TOKEN_BUDGET})"
    echo "TOKEN BUDGET DEFER: #${FINDING_NUM} (est. ${TOKEN_ESTIMATE_PER_FINDING} tokens, projected total ${PROJECTED_TOKEN_SPEND} > ${TOKEN_BUDGET})"
  else
    BATCH_TOKEN_SPEND=$PROJECTED_TOKEN_SPEND
  fi
done

# Remove budget-deferred units from QUEUED_FINDINGS — they move to DEFERRED_FINDINGS/
# TOKEN_DEFERRED instead of dispatching this cycle. Re-evaluable in Step 4F.2.6, never
# permanent (distinct from the generation>=2 bucket in Step 4F.1).
if [ "${#TOKEN_BUDGET_DEFERRED_THIS_RUN[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
  QUEUED_FINDINGS=($(printf '%s\n' "${QUEUED_FINDINGS[@]}" | grep -vxF -f <(printf '%s\n' "${TOKEN_BUDGET_DEFERRED_THIS_RUN[@]}") || true))
  DEFERRED_FINDINGS+=("${TOKEN_BUDGET_DEFERRED_THIS_RUN[@]}")
  echo "Token budget: deferred ${#TOKEN_BUDGET_DEFERRED_THIS_RUN[@]} P3-and-below unit(s) this cycle — batch spend now ${BATCH_TOKEN_SPEND}/${TOKEN_BUDGET}"
fi
```

**Classify lane for each queued finding (MANDATORY — before dispatch)** <!-- Added: forge#2629 -->

Cascade-dispatched findings inherit NO lane assumption from the parent batch. Step 4A.pre's classify-lane loop (above) only covers `{ready_issue_numbers}` — the *original* dispatch group — and does not see findings discovered mid-run by this Step 4C pass. Without an explicit gate here, a finding reaches the Step 4A/4B dispatch loop with `${ISSUE_LANE[$NUM]}`/`${ISSUE_PR_BASE[$NUM]}` unset for its number, which is exactly the milestone-owned-finding-misrouted-to-staging risk this issue exists to close. Run this loop over `QUEUED_FINDINGS` (the post-clubbing, post-token-budget-gate list) before any of the numbered steps below, reusing the identical `classify-lane.sh` invocation and failure handling as Step 4A.pre — same script, same batch-scope `ISSUE_LANE`/`ISSUE_PR_BASE` arrays (declared once, line ~362-363), no new mechanism:

```bash
for FINDING_NUM in "${QUEUED_FINDINGS[@]}"; do
  PR_BASE=$(bash "$CLASSIFY_LANE_SCRIPT" "$FINDING_NUM" -R {GH_REPO}) || {
    echo "ERROR: classify-lane.sh failed for #$FINDING_NUM — adding needs-human label and removing from QUEUED_FINDINGS" >&2
    # GOVERNOR-exempt: intentional coordination side-effect (best-effort lease/board/finding post), DRY_RUN-safe — reviewed & accepted for the check-command-side-effects gate. Flagged only by the staging->main full-diff; passes on every feature PR. forge#2627
    gh issue edit "$FINDING_NUM" -R {GH_REPO} --add-label "needs-human" 2>/dev/null || true
    QUEUED_FINDINGS=($(printf '%s\n' "${QUEUED_FINDINGS[@]}" | grep -vxF "$FINDING_NUM" || true))
    continue
  }
  # Derive LANE label from PR_BASE — identical rule to Step 4A.pre.
  if [ "$PR_BASE" = "staging" ]; then
    LANE="fast-lane"
  else
    LANE="feature-lane"
  fi
  ISSUE_LANE[$FINDING_NUM]="$LANE"
  ISSUE_PR_BASE[$FINDING_NUM]="$PR_BASE"
  echo "#$FINDING_NUM → lane=$LANE, PR_BASE=$PR_BASE (cascade finding)"
done
```

A finding that fails classify-lane is removed from `QUEUED_FINDINGS` (mirrors Step 4A.pre's `continue`, which never admits a failed classification into the ready set) and flagged `needs-human` instead of silently falling through to the dispatch loop with an unset lane.

**For queued (non-deferred) findings:**

1. **Add them to the dependency DAG.** They are implementation issues — same as issues spawned by investigations in Phase 2. Compute their predecessor sets using the same conflict detection (Step 3C Layers 1-4) against all remaining blocked/active issues.
2. **Respect source branch context.** Review-finding issues have `**Code branch**: \`{branch}\`` in their body — the `/work-on` agent will read this and branch from the right origin (the body annotation is repaired earlier in this step if missing — see the Code-branch repair guard above). Separately, and mandatorily, `${ISSUE_LANE[$NUM]}`/`${ISSUE_PR_BASE[$NUM]}` are now populated by the classify-lane loop immediately above this list — every queued finding is lane-classified individually, inheriting no lane assumption from the parent batch, before it reaches the standard Step 4A/4B dispatch loop.
3. **Report to user:**
   ```
   Agent #{COMPLETED} spawned {count} new finding issues: #{A}, #{B}
   Added to DAG: #{A} (predecessors: {}), #{B} (predecessors: {#{X}})
   Deferred (cascade control): #{C} (P3 same-file), #{D} (comment heuristic), #{E} (token budget)
   ```
4. **Re-run file-overlap detection** (Step 3C) on the expanded issue set — finding issues may conflict with active or queued issues that touch the same files. Ready findings dispatch immediately via the standard Step 4B dispatch loop.

**For deferred findings:**

Track them in `DEFERRED_FINDINGS` for re-evaluation in Step 4F (Completion Sweep) after the DAG drains. Do NOT close or label them yet — the sweep will determine their final disposition.

**If no review-finding issues were spawned:** Continue monitoring for the next agent completion.

### Step 4C.5: Milestone lane-consistency check (periodic) <!-- Added: forge#901 -->

**WHY THIS EXISTS**: A milestone's feature-lane PRs must all target the same milestone branch. If a branch-routing race ever scatters them — some on the milestone branch, some on staging — the milestone branch becomes incomplete relative to staging, and the split is otherwise invisible until the milestone tries to ship. Step 4A.pre.0 prevents the split deterministically; this check detects any residual split so it surfaces immediately instead of at ship time.

**When to run**: After every 3rd agent completion (or after all agents complete, whichever comes first), for any batch where at least one issue has a milestone. Skip for pure fast-lane batches. This check is **non-blocking** — it alerts; it does not auto-resolve or stop the pipeline.

```bash
# For each distinct milestone in the batch, assert all of its feature-lane PRs share one base.
for NUM in {all_batch_issue_numbers}; do
  MILESTONE_TITLE=$(gh issue view "$NUM" -R {GH_REPO} --json milestone --jq '.milestone.title // empty' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
  [ -z "$MILESTONE_TITLE" ] && continue

  SLUG=$(echo "$MILESTONE_TITLE" \
    | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
    | tr ' ' '-' \
    | tr -cd 'a-z0-9-' \
    | sed 's/--*/-/g' \
    | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//')
  [ -z "$SLUG" ] && continue
  EXPECTED_BASE="milestone/$SLUG"

  # Collect the base branch of every PR that closes an issue in this milestone.
  # Iterate the milestone's issues and read each one's linked PR base.
  # Exclude CLOSED-unmerged PRs: a closed-but-not-merged PR is a superseded/abandoned
  # routing attempt and does NOT reflect the live lane. Keep only OPEN (in-flight) and
  # MERGED (landed) PRs. `gh pr list --state` cannot combine open+merged, so query all
  # and drop CLOSED in jq.
  BASES=$(gh pr list -R {GH_REPO} --state all --search "milestone:\"$MILESTONE_TITLE\"" \
    --json baseRefName,state --jq '.[] | select(.state != "CLOSED") | .baseRefName' 2>/dev/null | sort -u)
  # Fallback: if PR search by milestone is unavailable, derive from the issues' linked PRs.
  if [ -z "$BASES" ]; then
    BASES=$(for IN in {all_batch_issue_numbers}; do
      IM=$(gh issue view "$IN" -R {GH_REPO} --json milestone --jq '.milestone.title // empty' 2>/dev/null)
      [ "$IM" = "$MILESTONE_TITLE" ] || continue
      gh pr list -R {GH_REPO} --state all --search "$IN in:body" \
        --json baseRefName,state --jq '.[] | select(.state != "CLOSED") | .baseRefName' 2>/dev/null
    done | sort -u)
  fi

  STRAY_BASES=$(echo "$BASES" | grep -v "^${EXPECTED_BASE}\$" | grep -v '^$' || true)
  if [ -n "$STRAY_BASES" ]; then
    echo "ALERT: milestone '$MILESTONE_TITLE' has feature-lane PRs split across multiple base branches." >&2
    echo "       Expected base: $EXPECTED_BASE" >&2
    echo "       Found bases:" >&2
    echo "$BASES" | sed 's/^/         - /' >&2
    echo "       This indicates a branch-routing split — reconcile the stray PRs onto $EXPECTED_BASE" >&2
    echo "       (rebase/cherry-pick the stray branch onto the milestone branch) before the milestone ships." >&2
    # Do NOT auto-stop or auto-resolve — surface the alert and let the user decide.
  else
    echo "Lane-consistency OK: all '$MILESTONE_TITLE' PRs target $EXPECTED_BASE."
  fi
done
```

Report any `ALERT` lines prominently before dispatching more agents. Reconciliation of an existing split is a manual/`/milestone`-assisted step — this check only ensures the split is never silent.

### Step 4D: Milestone integration build gate (MANDATORY — periodic for milestone batches)

**WHY THIS EXISTS**: Session Intelligence milestone shipped 116 PRs across multiple dispatches with zero integration testing. Each PR built in isolation — type errors from cross-PR interactions (wrong prop types, missing components, incompatible interfaces) were invisible until the milestone→staging merge broke the build with 4 distinct errors. This gate catches those failures early.

**When to run**: After every 3rd milestone-targeted agent completion (or when all milestone issues are complete), IF the batch targets a milestone branch AND any `.tsx`/`.ts` files were changed by agents in the completed set. Running after every single agent would be too frequent — batch the check to reduce overhead while still catching integration errors before they accumulate.

All tool commands are read from `forge.yaml → verification.commands`; each step logs `SKIPPED — not configured` when the corresponding key is absent rather than silently passing.

```bash
# Read toolchain commands from forge.yaml
TS_TYPECHECK=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.typecheck // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
TS_BUILD=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.build // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
PYTHON_FORMAT=$(yq '.verification.commands.python.format // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')

# Check if this is a milestone batch with TypeScript changes
MILESTONE_BRANCH="milestone/{milestone_slug}"
TS_CHANGED=$(git diff origin/{DEFAULT_BRANCH}...origin/${MILESTONE_BRANCH} --name-only | grep -E '\.(tsx?|jsx?)$' | head -1)

if [ -n "$TS_CHANGED" ]; then
    echo "=== Integration Build Gate (TypeScript): batch checkpoint ==="
    cd {REPO_PATH}
    git fetch origin ${MILESTONE_BRANCH}
    git checkout origin/${MILESTONE_BRANCH} --detach 2>/dev/null

    if [ -n "$TS_TYPECHECK" ]; then
        eval "$TS_TYPECHECK" 2>&1 | head -30
        TSC_EXIT=$?
    else
        echo "SKIPPED — typescript.typecheck not configured in verification.commands"
        TSC_EXIT=0
    fi

    if [ "$TSC_EXIT" -eq 0 ] && [ -n "$TS_BUILD" ]; then
        eval "$TS_BUILD" 2>&1 | tail -30
        BUILD_EXIT=$?
    elif [ -z "$TS_BUILD" ]; then
        echo "SKIPPED — typescript.build not configured in verification.commands"
        BUILD_EXIT=0
    fi

    git checkout - 2>/dev/null

    if [ "$TSC_EXIT" -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "BLOCKING: TypeScript errors on ${MILESTONE_BRANCH} after batch checkpoint."
        echo "Fix type errors before dispatching more milestone agents."
    elif [ "${BUILD_EXIT:-0}" -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "BLOCKING: build failed on ${MILESTONE_BRANCH} after batch checkpoint."
        echo "Build/prerender errors — fix before dispatching more milestone agents."
    fi
fi

# Python format check
PY_CHANGED=$(git diff origin/{DEFAULT_BRANCH}...origin/${MILESTONE_BRANCH} --name-only | grep -E '\.py$' | head -1)
if [ -n "$PY_CHANGED" ]; then
    echo "=== Integration Build Gate (Python): batch checkpoint ==="
    cd {REPO_PATH}
    git checkout origin/${MILESTONE_BRANCH} --detach 2>/dev/null

    if [ -n "$PYTHON_FORMAT" ]; then
        eval "$PYTHON_FORMAT" 2>&1 | tail -10
        FORMAT_EXIT=$?
    else
        echo "SKIPPED — python.format not configured in verification.commands"
        FORMAT_EXIT=0
    fi

    git checkout - 2>/dev/null

    if [ "$FORMAT_EXIT" -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "WARNING: Python formatting issues on ${MILESTONE_BRANCH} after batch checkpoint."
        echo "Not blocking but should be fixed before milestone→staging."
    fi
fi
```

**If the gate fails**: Report the errors to the user. Do NOT dispatch any more milestone-targeted agents until the integration errors are resolved. The accumulated milestone branch has integration errors that will only get worse with more PRs on top. Build failures are BLOCKING — SSG/prerender crashes are invisible to typecheck alone — configure `typescript.build` in `verification.commands` to catch them. Non-milestone (fast-lane) agents may continue dispatching normally.

### Step 4E: Handle individual agent failures

If an agent reports failure or error:
- **Merge conflict**: Report to user, mark issue as needing human attention (`needs-human`). This classifies as **GATED**, not FAILED — see Predecessor Classification in Step 4B. Its dependents follow the Dependency cascade rule below, not a hard skip.
- **Invalid issue**: Already handled by the agent (closed with comment) — just report it. This classifies as **FAILED**.
- **Build/test failure**: Report the error, suggest manual intervention. This classifies as **FAILED**.
- **Agent timeout**: Report which issue timed out, suggest re-running with `/work-on #{N}`. Not yet terminal — leave dependents in `IN_PROGRESS` wait, no cascade action.
- **Dependency cascade** <!-- Updated: forge#1812 -->: Re-run `classify_predecessor_state` (Step 4B) for the failed/gated issue before cascading — do NOT assume every entry above is a hard failure:
  - If it classifies **FAILED** (invalid, or build/test failure): mark all transitive dependents in the DAG as "skipped — dependency #{X} failed" (same as Step 4B item 6).
  - If it classifies **GATED** (merge conflict → `needs-human`, or `workflow:awaiting-merge`): do NOT mark dependents skipped. Instead apply Step 4B item 6.5 — track each direct dependent as `blocked-on-human-merge` against this predecessor, so it auto-dispatches via item 6.6 the moment the predecessor reaches `workflow:merged`.

**Do NOT retry failed agents automatically.** Report the failure and let the user decide.

### Step 4F: Completion Sweep (deferred review-spawned findings) <!-- Added: forge#1105 -->

**When to run**: After all DAG issues reach terminal state AND `DEFERRED_FINDINGS` is non-empty. Skip if no findings were deferred during this batch.

**WHY THIS EXISTS**: Deferred findings accumulate during the batch because of file-overlap and cascade-control heuristics (Step 4C). But once the DAG drains, the conditions that caused deferral often no longer apply — completed issues no longer occupy files, so same-file overlap vanishes. Without this sweep, deferred findings silently pile up across runs and never get resolved.

**Step 4F.1: Classify deferred findings into permanent vs re-evaluable vs idle-gated vs token-gated**

```bash
PERMANENT_DEFERRED=()
SWEEP_CANDIDATES=()
IDLE_DEFERRED=()   # <!-- Added: forge#1814 -->
TOKEN_GATED=()     # <!-- Added: forge#1858 -->

for FINDING_NUM in "${DEFERRED_FINDINGS[@]}"; do
  DEFER_REASON="${DEFERRED_REASONS[$FINDING_NUM]}"

  # Generation >= 2 deferrals are PERMANENT — unbounded cascade prevention
  if echo "$DEFER_REASON" | grep -qi "generation"; then
    PERMANENT_DEFERRED+=($FINDING_NUM)
  # "Batch fully human-gated" deferrals (forge#1814) are their OWN bucket — they must NOT be
  # re-evaluated by the file-overlap logic in Step 4F.2 below, because the reason they were
  # deferred has nothing to do with file overlap. Re-evaluating them the same way as
  # comment/typo or P3-same-file deferrals would silently undo the idle policy: a sweep can
  # run while the batch is still a "paused drain" (Step 4B's Termination condition explicitly
  # allows Step 4F to run in that state), and BATCH_FULLY_GATED would still be true at sweep
  # time unless a human has actually merged a gating PR in the meantime.
  elif echo "$DEFER_REASON" | grep -qi "batch fully human-gated"; then
    IDLE_DEFERRED+=($FINDING_NUM)
  # "Token budget exceeded" deferrals (forge#1858) are ALSO their own bucket — re-evaluating
  # them via the file-overlap logic in Step 4F.2 would incorrectly clear them (they were never
  # deferred for file-overlap reasons) without checking whether token headroom actually exists.
  # See Step 4F.2.6 below, which mirrors the Step 4F.2.5 idle-gated pattern.
  elif echo "$DEFER_REASON" | grep -qi "token budget"; then
    TOKEN_GATED+=($FINDING_NUM)
  else
    # All other deferrals (comment/typo, P3 same-file) are re-evaluable
    SWEEP_CANDIDATES+=($FINDING_NUM)
  fi
done

echo "Completion sweep: ${#SWEEP_CANDIDATES[@]} re-evaluable, ${#PERMANENT_DEFERRED[@]} permanent, ${#IDLE_DEFERRED[@]} idle-gated, ${#TOKEN_GATED[@]} token-gated"
```

**Step 4F.2: Re-evaluate sweep candidates**

Re-run the Step 4C heuristics against the now-empty DAG. Since all original batch issues are in terminal state, the `ALL_BATCH_FILES` list for file-overlap detection is empty — P3 same-file deferrals will now pass.

```bash
SWEEP_EXECUTE=()
SWEEP_STILL_DEFERRED=()

for FINDING_NUM in "${SWEEP_CANDIDATES[@]}"; do
  FINDING_DATA=$(gh issue view $FINDING_NUM -R {GH_REPO} --json labels,title,body,state \
    --jq '{labels: [.labels[].name], title: .title, body: .body, state: .state}')

  # Skip if already closed (resolved by another process)
  STATE=$(echo "$FINDING_DATA" | jq -r '.state')
  [ "$STATE" = "CLOSED" ] && continue

  # Schema-tolerant extraction (forge#2232), mirrors the Step 4C main loop above.
  # PRIORITY is not currently read by the branches below (comment/typo is title-only),
  # kept normalized for consistency and to avoid reintroducing the schema bug if a
  # future rule here starts branching on it. NOTE: $FINDING_DATA.labels here is already
  # a flat array of label-name strings (see the --jq above: {labels: [.labels[].name], ...}),
  # so this reads `.labels[]` directly, not `.labels[].name`.
  PRIORITY=$(echo "$FINDING_DATA" | jq -r '
    ([.labels[] | select(test("^priority:P[0-9]+$"))] | .[0]) //
    ([.labels[] | select(test("^P[0-9]+$"))] | .[0]) //
    "" | ltrimstr("priority:")')
  TITLE=$(echo "$FINDING_DATA" | jq -r '.title')

  # Re-apply heuristics against the drained DAG (no active batch files)
  # Comment/typo heuristic still applies — these are cosmetic regardless of DAG state
  if echo "$TITLE" | grep -qi "comment\|typo"; then
    SWEEP_STILL_DEFERRED+=($FINDING_NUM)
    echo "Sweep: #${FINDING_NUM} still deferred (comment/typo — cosmetic)"
  else
    # P3 same-file overlap no longer applies (DAG is drained, no active files)
    # All other findings are safe to execute
    SWEEP_EXECUTE+=($FINDING_NUM)
    echo "Sweep: #${FINDING_NUM} cleared for execution (file overlap resolved)"
  fi
done
```

**Step 4F.2.5: Re-evaluate idle-gated deferrals** <!-- Added: forge#1814 -->

Recompute `BATCH_FULLY_GATED` fresh at sweep time (same check as Step 4B item 6.7, over `{all_batch_issue_numbers}`) — do NOT reuse a stale value captured when the finding was originally deferred. If a human has merged a gating PR since the finding was deferred, the original batch is no longer fully gated and the finding is safe to execute; otherwise it stays deferred.

```bash
# Skip the recompute entirely if nothing was idle-gated this run — no need to spend API
# calls re-classifying the original batch for a bucket with zero members.
if [ "${#IDLE_DEFERRED[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
  ANY_ORIGINAL_IN_PROGRESS=false
  ANY_ORIGINAL_GATED=false
  for ORIG_NUM in {all_batch_issue_numbers}; do
    ORIG_STATE=$(classify_predecessor_state "$ORIG_NUM")
    case "$ORIG_STATE" in
      IN_PROGRESS) ANY_ORIGINAL_IN_PROGRESS=true ;;
      GATED) ANY_ORIGINAL_GATED=true ;;
      DONE|FAILED) ;;
    esac
  done
  if [ "$ANY_ORIGINAL_IN_PROGRESS" = "false" ] && [ "$ANY_ORIGINAL_GATED" = "true" ]; then
    BATCH_FULLY_GATED=true
  else
    BATCH_FULLY_GATED=false
  fi
fi

for FINDING_NUM in "${IDLE_DEFERRED[@]}"; do
  if [ "${BATCH_FULLY_GATED:-false}" = "true" ]; then
    SWEEP_STILL_DEFERRED+=($FINDING_NUM)
    echo "Sweep: #${FINDING_NUM} still deferred (batch still fully human-gated — idle policy)"
  else
    SWEEP_EXECUTE+=($FINDING_NUM)
    echo "Sweep: #${FINDING_NUM} cleared for execution (batch no longer fully gated — a gating PR merged)"
  fi
done
```

**Step 4F.2.6: Re-evaluate token-gated deferrals** <!-- Added: forge#1858 -->

The original batch has now drained — the token spend that caused these deferrals belongs to a batch that is no longer competing for dispatch. Re-evaluate `TOKEN_GATED` against a **fresh, sweep-scoped** token allowance (`SWEEP_TOKEN_SPEND`, separate from the drained `BATCH_TOKEN_SPEND` — do NOT reuse or reset the original batch counter, which other reporting still reads in Step 6B). This mirrors the file-overlap re-check in Step 4F.2 (which also benefits from the drained-DAG state) rather than the idle-gated re-check in Step 4F.2.5 (which re-tests an external condition, not a resettable budget).

```bash
# Skip entirely if nothing was token-gated this run.
if [ "${#TOKEN_GATED[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
  SWEEP_TOKEN_SPEND=0

  for FINDING_NUM in "${TOKEN_GATED[@]}"; do
    STATE=$(gh issue view "$FINDING_NUM" -R {GH_REPO} --json state --jq '.state' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
    [ "$STATE" = "CLOSED" ] && continue   # resolved by another process — drop silently

    PROJECTED_SWEEP_SPEND=$((SWEEP_TOKEN_SPEND + TOKEN_ESTIMATE_PER_FINDING))
    if [ "$TOKEN_BUDGET" != "unlimited" ] && [ "$PROJECTED_SWEEP_SPEND" -gt "$TOKEN_BUDGET" ]; then
      SWEEP_STILL_DEFERRED+=($FINDING_NUM)
      echo "Sweep: #${FINDING_NUM} still deferred (token budget — sweep allowance ${TOKEN_BUDGET} would be exceeded at ${PROJECTED_SWEEP_SPEND})"
    else
      SWEEP_TOKEN_SPEND=$PROJECTED_SWEEP_SPEND
      SWEEP_EXECUTE+=($FINDING_NUM)
      echo "Sweep: #${FINDING_NUM} cleared for execution (fits fresh sweep token allowance — ${SWEEP_TOKEN_SPEND}/${TOKEN_BUDGET})"
    fi
  done
fi
```

Findings that still don't fit the fresh sweep allowance remain deferred — never permanent (unlike `generation >= 2`). They are re-evaluated again on the next `/orchestrate` invocation or completion sweep, exactly like comment/typo and P3-same-file deferrals.

**Step 4F.3: Dispatch cleared findings**

For each finding in `SWEEP_EXECUTE`, add it to a fresh sweep DAG and dispatch using the same Steps 4A.pre.0, 4A.pre, and 4A logic. Run file-overlap detection between the swept findings themselves (they may conflict with each other).

**MANDATORY**: Use the full Step 4A agent template verbatim for each swept finding. Do NOT use a bare `prompt="Run /work-on N"` — that bypasses the label-state loop contract, source branch detection, and all pipeline enforcement rules. Swept findings are always `review-finding` issues that require source branch detection to route correctly.

**Step 4F.3.pre: Classify lane for each sweep finding (MANDATORY before dispatching)**

Run `classify-lane.sh` per finding — same pattern as Step 4A.pre:

```bash
declare -A SWEEP_LANE
declare -A SWEEP_PR_BASE

for FINDING_NUM in "${SWEEP_EXECUTE[@]}"; do
  SWEEP_BASE=$(bash "$CLASSIFY_LANE_SCRIPT" "$FINDING_NUM" -R {GH_REPO}) || {
    echo "ERROR: classify-lane.sh failed for #$FINDING_NUM — adding needs-human and skipping" >&2
    # GOVERNOR-exempt: intentional coordination side-effect (best-effort lease/board/finding post), DRY_RUN-safe — reviewed & accepted for the check-command-side-effects gate. Flagged only by the staging->main full-diff; passes on every feature PR. forge#2627
    gh issue edit "$FINDING_NUM" -R {GH_REPO} --add-label "needs-human" 2>/dev/null || true

      prompt="You are working on GitHub issue #${FINDING_NUM} for the {PROJECT_NAME} project.

**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME}
**Repository**: {GH_REPO}
**Repo path**: {REPO_PATH}

**KNOWLEDGE GIST CAPABILITY**: This orchestration already probed it: `${FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE}`. Before invoking `/work-on`, run `export FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE=${FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE}`. Do not re-probe or attempt Gist creation when it is `false`.

**YOUR MISSION**: Invoke \`/work-on\` via the Skill tool and let it run to completion. \`/work-on\` is a self-contained routing loop that handles the ENTIRE pipeline: investigate → build (context → architect → implement → validate) → review (push → PR → /review-pr --auto-merge) → close (project board → trajectory log → worktree cleanup). Do NOT intervene, compensate, or manually close issues — \`/work-on\` handles everything including issue closure and label updates in its close phase.

**CRITICAL — DO NOT STOP EARLY**: /work-on runs as a multi-phase routing loop. Each phase (investigate, build, review, close) returns an intermediate result — these are NOT completion signals. You are NOT done until the issue reaches a terminal state: \`workflow:merged\`, \`workflow:invalid\`, \`needs-human\`, or \`workflow:awaiting-merge\`. If /work-on returns after only one phase (e.g., investigation), you MUST invoke it again immediately — it will re-read GitHub state and continue to the next phase. Keep invoking /work-on until it reaches a terminal state. Never output 'done' or stop after an intermediate result.

**HOW REVIEW FINDINGS WORK**: /review-pr may create GitHub issues (with \`review-finding\` label) for findings it discovers. These are NOT blockers — they are separate work items that will go through their own /work-on pipeline later. The original PR should ALWAYS merge after review. The only exception is build errors (code doesn't compile) — those must be fixed before merging.

**IMPORTANT RULES**:
- **MANDATORY**: You MUST use the Skill tool to invoke 'work-on' with args '${FINDING_NUM}'. Do NOT implement manually — /work-on handles the full pipeline including label state machine (workflow:investigating → workflow:building → workflow:in-review → workflow:merged), investigation reports, PR creation, and cleanup.
  - For default repo issues: \`Skill(skill='work-on', args='${FINDING_NUM} --under-orchestration')\`
  - For satellite repo issues: \`Skill(skill='work-on', args='{SATELLITE_PREFIX}:${FINDING_NUM} --under-orchestration')\` (prefix from forge.yaml → repos.satellites)
- NEVER bypass /work-on with manual git/gh commands — the label updates and structured comments are critical for tracking
- NEVER target \`main\` for PRs targeting the default repo. Use \`{STAGING_BRANCH}\` for fast-lane issues, or \`milestone/{slug}\` for milestone issues.
- Satellite repos (MCP, n8n) have no staging branch — fast-lane PRs go to \`main\` for those.
- If the issue is INVALID after investigation, close it with a comment explaining why
- If you hit merge conflicts or blockers, post a comment on the issue and STOP — do not force anything
- Do not interact with the user — you are running autonomously in the background
- **NEVER ask the user questions** — you are a background agent. If review finds issues, auto-fix simple ones and proceed, then let `/review-pr`'s own verdict decide: APPROVED (no unresolved CONFIRMED HIGH/CRITICAL finding) → merge to `staging` and create follow-up issues for the rest, **regardless of domain**. Domain alone (AUTH, BILLING, DATABASE, or any domain tagged as security-critical in Step 3B) is NOT a reason to add `needs-human` and stop — `staging` is reversible; the real human deploy gate is `staging → main`, not this merge. <!-- Added: forge#1815 --> `needs-human` is reserved for what the pipeline genuinely cannot do itself: spend/procurement decisions, real-environment validation it has no access to, product/architecture judgment calls a human must make, or `/review-pr`'s existing evidence-based escalations (spec-evolution guard, novel task-type/module-combo trust escalation, calibration-based overconfidence routing). An unresolved CONFIRMED HIGH/CRITICAL finding is `/review-pr`'s own withheld-APPROVED case, not a domain-driven `needs-human` halt — `/review-pr` already refuses to return APPROVED when that's true, so there is no separate domain check to perform here.

**LABEL-STATE LOOP CONTRACT — enforce after EVERY Skill return**:
After EVERY \`Skill(skill='work-on', ...)\` call returns, immediately check the issue's current workflow label:
\`\`\`bash
gh issue view ${FINDING_NUM} -R {GH_REPO} --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name | select(startswith(\"workflow:\"))]'
\`\`\`
**Terminal labels** (only these allow you to stop): \`workflow:merged\`, \`workflow:invalid\`
**Terminal condition also**: \`needs-human\` label present, \`workflow:awaiting-merge\` label present, OR issue state is \`closed\`
If the label is NOT terminal (e.g., \`workflow:investigating\`, \`workflow:ready-to-build\`, \`workflow:building\`, \`workflow:in-review\`), invoke \`Skill(skill='work-on', args='${FINDING_NUM} --under-orchestration')\` again immediately. The \`/work-on\` skill will re-read GitHub state and advance to the next phase. Do NOT output a summary, do NOT pause, do NOT ask for confirmation — just invoke it again.

**CRITICAL — SOURCE BRANCH DETECTION**:
- If the issue has the \`review-finding\` label, read the issue body for \`**Code branch**: \\\`{branch}\\\`\`
- If found, that is the SOURCE_BRANCH — the code ONLY exists on that branch (e.g., \`staging\`), NOT on \`origin/main\`
- Investigation MUST use \`git show origin/{SOURCE_BRANCH}:{filepath}\` to verify the code exists
- Worktree MUST branch from \`origin/{SOURCE_BRANCH}\`, NOT \`origin/main\`
- PR target is \`{SOURCE_BRANCH}\` (the fix goes back to where the code lives)

**LANE**: ${SWEEP_LANE[$FINDING_NUM]} (PR target: ${SWEEP_PR_BASE[$FINDING_NUM]})
**Issue title**: ${FINDING_TITLE}

  # Monitor sweep agents using the same Step 4B completion loop
  # IMPORTANT: Findings spawned by sweep agents are NOT re-swept —

fi
```

**Step 4F.4: Report sweep results**

```
Completion Sweep Results:
  Dispatched: #{A}, #{B} (file overlap cleared after DAG drain)
  Still deferred (cosmetic): #{C} (comment/typo)
  Permanently deferred (gen2): #{D} (generation >= 2 cascade cap — requires manual /work-on, or an explicit `cascade`/`review-findings --allow-gen2` request via phase-1-resolve.md; see #2231/#2234)
  Idle-gated — still deferred: #{E} (batch still fully human-gated — waiting on a merge)
  Idle-gated — cleared: #{F} (a gating PR merged since deferral — no longer idle)
  Token-gated — cleared: #{G} (fits fresh sweep token allowance — batch spend ${SWEEP_TOKEN_SPEND}/${TOKEN_BUDGET})
  Token-gated — still deferred: #{H} (sweep allowance also exhausted — re-evaluable next run)
```

**After sweep agents complete** (or if no findings were dispatched): output the budget deferred-issues report (if applicable), **call `release_orchestrator_lease()` (Step 4A-pre.-1)** — the sweep is this session's last dispatch activity, so the lease must not be left held for a now-idle session (the Termination condition's own release call, above, only fires on the no-deferred-findings branch; this is the equivalent release for the deferred-findings/Completion Sweep branch) <!-- Added: forge#2627 -->, then proceed to Phase 5.

**Anti-patterns — DO NOT DO THIS:**
- Re-sweeping findings spawned during the sweep itself — this creates unbounded recursion. Sweep is a single pass.
- Overriding generation >= 2 deferrals **inside this Step 4C mid-run triage** — the cascade cap is absolute for autonomous cascade: a sweep or triage pass must never promote a gen≥2 finding to executed just because it looks low-risk. This is distinct from an explicit human request made *before* the run starts: an operator may deliberately admit gen≥2 findings via `phase-1-resolve.md`'s `cascade`/`review-findings`/`findings` resolution with `--include-deferred`/`--allow-gen2` (or the `orchestration.cascade.max_generation` config lever from #2234) — that is the sanctioned override path, entered at Phase 1 resolution, not a violation of this rule. Do not use that human-request path as precedent to relax Step 4C itself. <!-- Added: forge#2231 -->
- Skipping the sweep because "there are only a few" deferred findings — even one deferred finding represents unresolved work.
- Clearing an idle-gated deferral (forge#1814) without recomputing `BATCH_FULLY_GATED` fresh at sweep time — a stale "not gated" read would re-introduce the exact net-negative churn this policy exists to stop.
- Clearing a token-gated deferral (forge#1858) by reusing the drained `BATCH_TOKEN_SPEND` instead of the fresh `SWEEP_TOKEN_SPEND` allowance — the whole point of Step 4F.2.6 is that the *original* batch's spend is no longer relevant once it has drained.

### Step 4F.5: Budget Deferred-Issues Report (conditional) <!-- Added: forge#1743 -->

**Run only when `BUDGET_LIMIT != "Infinity"` AND `${#DEFERRED_BUDGET_ISSUES[@]} > 0`.**

Deferred issues are issues that were not dispatched because their estimated cost would have pushed projected spend past the budget ceiling (after reserving ε for no-prior issues). They are **never silently dropped** — this report makes them visible and actionable.

```bash
if [ "$BUDGET_LIMIT" != "Infinity" ] && [ "${#DEFERRED_BUDGET_ISSUES[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "## Budget Report"
  echo ""
  echo "**Budget limit**: \$${BUDGET_LIMIT}"
  echo "**Projected spend (dispatched issues)**: \$${PROJECTED_SPEND}"
  echo "**Actual spend (completed issues, best-effort)**: \$${ACTUAL_SPEND}"
  echo "**ε-reserve used**: ${EPSILON_DISPATCHED} (10% = \$${EPSILON_BUDGET})"
  echo ""
  echo "### Deferred Issues (budget exhausted — never silently dropped)"
  echo ""
  echo "| Issue | Title | Score | Est. Cost | Reason |"
  echo "|-------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|"
  for DNUM in "${DEFERRED_BUDGET_ISSUES[@]}"; do
    DTITLE=$(gh issue view "$DNUM" -R {GH_REPO} --json title --jq '.title' 2>/dev/null || echo "(unknown)")
    DSCORE="${ISSUE_SCORE[$DNUM]:-?}"
    DCOST="${ISSUE_COST_ESTIMATE[$DNUM]:-?}"
    echo "| #${DNUM} | ${DTITLE} | ${DSCORE} | \$${DCOST} | Budget ceiling reached |"
  done
  echo ""
  DEFERRED_LIST=$(IFS=' '; echo "${DEFERRED_BUDGET_ISSUES[*]}")
  echo "**Action**: Re-run \`/orchestrate ${DEFERRED_LIST} [--budget N]\` to process deferred issues, or increase \`--budget\`."
fi
```
