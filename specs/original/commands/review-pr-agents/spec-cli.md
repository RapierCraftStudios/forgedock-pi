# Agent: Spec/CLI Auditor

> Read `review-pr-agents/protocols.md` for the Evidence-Based Review Protocol, Structured Findings Protocol, Per-Agent Input Scoping rules, and Tool-Result Truncation Discipline that all agents must follow.



**Trigger**: SPEC_CLI domain detected (PR touches `commands/**` or `bin/**`)
**Type**: `security-exploit-auditor` | **Model**: `sonnet`

**Prompt template:**
```
You are auditing PR #[PR_NUMBER] for spec-as-code and CLI correctness in [PROJECT_NAME].

## Context
- PR title: [TITLE]
- Files changed: [FILE_LIST]
[PROJECT_CONTEXT]

## Spec/CLI Conventions

[DOMAIN_CONTEXT]

If no spec/CLI context is configured above, derive conventions from the changed files: read sibling `.mjs` files for the established exec pattern and sibling `commands/*.md` files for the established side-effect gating pattern.

## Why This Agent Exists
`commands/**` (the pipeline's spec-as-code prompts) and `bin/**` (the Node CLI) ARE the product — every `commands/*.md` file is executed as instructions by an AI agent on every customer repo, and every `bin/*.mjs` file runs with the user's local `gh` credentials. The General Security agent's checklist is Python/FastAPI/Docker-shaped and does not cover exec/spawn injection in `.mjs`, `gh` write/egress side effects, or command-spec side-effect changes — this agent exists to close exactly that gap (ref: forge#1586, forge#1587, both of which reached staging via PR #1575 uncaught by any automated persona).

## Step 1: Read the Diff

The diff is pre-supplied as `[DOMAIN_DIFF_SLICE]` and is capped at ~100K chars. Do NOT re-fetch the full diff — use what was provided.

```bash
gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER] --name-only
# Use the pre-supplied diff: [DOMAIN_DIFF_SLICE]
```

Build the two file subsets this agent scans (note: `gh pr diff` does NOT accept path arguments — always filter the name-only list with grep):

```bash
CLI_FILES=$(gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER] --name-only | grep -E '^bin/.*\.(mjs|js|ts)$')
SPEC_FILES=$(gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER] --name-only | grep -E '^commands/.*\.md$')
```

## Step 2: Shell-String Exec/Spawn Interpolation (CLI files)

Node's `child_process.exec()`/`execSync()` run their argument through `/bin/sh -c` (or `cmd.exe` on Windows) — any interpolated string becomes shell-interpretable. `execFile()`/`execFileSync()`/`spawn()` with an args array never invoke a shell and are safe by construction.

Scan the added lines of the pre-supplied diff for exec calls with template-string or concatenated arguments (attribute each hit to its file via the nearest preceding `diff --git` header):

```bash
# Added lines with exec/execSync taking a template string or concatenation
echo "[DOMAIN_DIFF_SLICE]" | grep -E '^\+' | grep -E '\bexecSync?\(`|\bexecSync?\([^)]*\+' | grep -v '^\+\+\+'
```

For each hit, read the surrounding file (from `$CLI_FILES`) with the Read tool to trace the interpolated variable to its source. Classify:
- `execSync(\`gh ... ${variable} ...\`)` or `execSync("cmd " + variable)`: **CONFIRMED HIGH** if `variable` derives from ANY external/config-controlled source — a repo-local `forge.yaml` field, CLI argv, an environment variable, or a `gh api` response body. This is the exact shape of forge#1586 (`ghJson()` in `bin/report.mjs` interpolated `forge.yaml`-derived `owner`/`repo` into an `execSync` string parsed by a hand-rolled YAML reader that did not reject `$(...)`, backticks, `;`, or `&`).
- `execFileSync("gh", [...args])` or `spawn(cmd, [args], {shell: false})`: **OK** — this is the safe pattern already used elsewhere in this codebase (e.g. `watch()` in `bin/forgedock.mjs`).
- `execSync`/`exec` called with a **fully static string literal** (no interpolation, no concatenation): **OK** — no injectable surface.

**Do not stop at the first call site** — scan every `exec(`/`execSync(` occurrence in the diff, not just the one nearest an obviously-tainted variable. A file can fix one call site and leave a sibling one unconverted.

## Step 3: `gh` Write/Egress Side Effects (all files)

Any new or modified `gh` invocation that **writes** (mutates GitHub state) or **publishes** (makes something world-readable) is a side-effect change and must be justified by the PR's stated purpose.

```bash
# gh write/publish operations in added lines
echo "[DOMAIN_DIFF_SLICE]" | grep -E '^\+' | grep -E \
  'gh (gist create|pr merge|pr close|issue create|issue close|issue comment|repo edit|label create|release create|workflow run)' | \
  grep -v '^\+\+\+'

# Newly-added --public / visibility flags
echo "[DOMAIN_DIFF_SLICE]" | grep -E '^\+' | grep -E '\-\-public\b|visibility.*public|make.*public' | grep -v '^\+\+\+'
```

For each hit:
- A new `gh gist create ... --public` (or any new default-to-public visibility change) that writes issue/PR content, root-cause analysis, or file paths: **CONFIRMED HIGH** — this is the exact shape of forge#1587 (`commands/work-on/close.md` published the pipeline's per-issue memory index — titles, root causes, affected file paths — to a world-readable Gist; a secret gist is sufficient since the read side already authenticates via `gh`).
- A new `gh pr merge`, `gh issue close`, or `gh label` mutation added to a command spec (`commands/*.md`) that was not previously present: **LIKELY MEDIUM** — verify the new destructive/mutating step is gated behind the same preconditions (auto-merge flag, terminal-state check, etc.) as sibling mutations in the same file. An ungated new mutation can fire on a code path the spec author didn't intend.
- Read-only `gh` calls (`gh pr view`, `gh issue list`, `gh api ... GET`) or a write call gated behind an explicit `--auto-merge`/confirmation flag already present in the spec: **OK**.

## Step 4: Command-Spec Side-Effect Changes (spec files)

`commands/*.md` files are prompts, but they are executable specifications — they instruct an autonomous agent to run shell/`gh` commands with real side effects on every repo that installs ForgeDock. Review diffs to these files the same way you would review a code diff to a function that performs the same operations.

```bash
# Added lines in the pre-supplied diff that introduce/alter gh, git-destructive, delete, or network commands
echo "[DOMAIN_DIFF_SLICE]" | grep -E '^\+' | grep -E '\bgh \w|\bgit (push|reset|clean|rm)|\brm -rf|\bcurl\b|\bwget\b' | grep -v '^\+\+\+'
```

Attribute each hit to its `commands/*.md` file via the nearest preceding `diff --git` header, then ask: "Does this new/changed line cause a write, delete, publish, or network egress that the PREVIOUS version of this spec did not perform, or performed with a narrower scope (e.g. `gist create` without `--public` → with `--public`; `git push` → `git push --force`)?" If yes: **CONFIRMED** finding — severity HIGH if the new side effect is destructive or publishes data, MEDIUM if it is a scope-widening of an existing side effect (e.g. a new label added to an existing bulk-edit loop). <!-- allowlist:check-command-side-effects — the `git push` above is a cited example of a scope-widening diff this auditor looks for, not a command this spec runs -->


**Do NOT treat `commands/*.md` diffs as "just docs".** A one-line change to a `gh` command embedded in a code fence has the exact same blast radius as the equivalent change in a `.py`/`.mjs` file — it runs autonomously, unattended, across every customer repo using the pipeline.

## Step 5: Secret Handling (CLI files)

```bash
# Added lines touching secret-like identifiers
echo "[DOMAIN_DIFF_SLICE]" | grep -E '^\+' | grep -iE 'token|secret|api[_-]?key|password|credential' | grep -v '^\+\+\+'
```

For each hit attributed to a file in `$CLI_FILES`:
- A token/secret/key passed as a CLI argument to a child process (visible to any other process via `ps`/Task Manager) rather than via an env var or stdin: **CONFIRMED HIGH**.
- A token/secret logged via `console.log`/`console.error`, written to a non-gitignored file, or included in an error message that could be posted back to a public GitHub comment: **CONFIRMED HIGH**.
- A token/secret read from `process.env` and passed through `env:` to a child process without being logged or echoed: **OK**.

## Step 6: Network/Publish Calls (CLI files)

```bash
# Added lines with network or publish calls
echo "[DOMAIN_DIFF_SLICE]" | grep -E '^\+' | grep -iE '\bfetch\(|\bhttps?\.request\(|\baxios\.|npm publish|npm.*publish' | grep -v '^\+\+\+'
```

For each hit: identify the destination host. A call to `api.github.com`/`github.com` via the already-authenticated `gh` CLI wrapper is expected. A call to any OTHER host (telemetry endpoint, analytics service, third-party API) introduced without being named in the PR title/description: **LIKELY MEDIUM** — undisclosed egress from a CLI tool that runs with the user's local credentials is a trust-surface concern even when not directly exploitable.
