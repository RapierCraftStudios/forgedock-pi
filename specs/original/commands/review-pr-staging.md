# Staging Review

**Trigger**: Invoked by the orchestrator via `Skill("review-pr-staging", $ARGUMENTS)`, or directly with `$ARGUMENTS` = "staging", a PR number targeting main, or "staging:feature".

Performs comprehensive review of `staging` before merging to `main`. Handles large diffs (1,000-10,000+ lines), diverse changes, deep analysis, and business impact assessment.

**Agent model policy**: `model: "{DEFAULT_MODEL}"` — resolved from forge.yaml `agents.default_model`, else "sonnet" (standard tier). Fallback: `model: "opus"` if rate-limited. User can override with `--model <name>`. Feature gate: pass `effort` in Task/Skill spawns only on Claude Code >= 2.1.154.
**NEVER use plan mode (EnterPlanMode).**
**Sub-agent dispatch tool: `Task` preferred, `Agent` is the documented fallback.** This spec dispatches domain review agents via a sub-agent-spawning tool. Resolve which one is available ONCE per invocation, before Phase 3, per the **Sub-Agent Dispatch Tool Resolution** rule below — do not halt to ask the operator which tool to use. Never fall back to reviewing inline in the orchestrator's own context; that is a strictly weaker substitute for an isolated fresh-context reviewer and is not a permitted fallback.

<!-- FORGE:SPEC_LOADED — review-pr-staging.md loaded and active. Agent is bound by this spec. -->

## Sub-Agent Dispatch Tool Resolution (MANDATORY — run once, before Phase 3)

This spec dispatches Bug Hunter and domain review agents via a sub-agent-spawning tool. Different runtimes expose different tools for this — resolve deterministically, once per invocation, and use the same tool for every dispatch call in this run:

### OpenCode Runtime Override

When the workflow is running under OpenCode, resolve the native tool before applying the Claude-specific availability order above:

```bash
IS_OPENCODE_RUNTIME=false
if [ "${FORGE_RUNTIME:-}" = "opencode" ] ||
   [ -n "${OPENCODE_SESSION_ID:-}" ] ||
   [ -n "${OPENCODE_PID:-}" ] ||
   [ -n "${OPENCODE:-}" ]; then
  IS_OPENCODE_RUNTIME=true
  DISPATCH_TOOL=task
  DISPATCH_SUBAGENT_TYPE=general
fi
```

When `IS_OPENCODE_RUNTIME=true`, lowercase native `task` is the preferred isolated dispatch tool. Do not enter the `Neither tool is available` branch merely because Claude's literal `Task` and `Agent` names are absent. Every native task call must use a top-level `subagent_type`: `general` for implementation/review work and `explore` for read-only discovery (Claude `general-purpose` and `codebase-explorer` map to those values). Review tasks are foreground: wait for their completed result before synthesis. If the native `task` capability itself is absent from the current tool registry, use the existing hard-stop path and post `FORGE:REVIEW_BLOCKED`; never substitute inline review.

1. **If `Task` is available in the current environment**: set `{DISPATCH_TOOL} = Task`. This is the preferred tool — tightest `allowed-tools` scoping. (Identical resolution logic to `/review-pr` Phase 3C — do not diverge.)
2. **Else if `Agent` is available**: set `{DISPATCH_TOOL} = Agent`. This is the documented fallback, not a degraded path — use it exactly as you would `Task`: one call per selected agent (Bug Hunters in Phase 3, Code Quality in Phase 4, domain agents in Phase 5), same prompt template, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (or the closest equivalent the environment offers), same requirement that each agent posts its own findings directly to the PR via `gh pr comment`. Isolation and fresh-context review are preserved either way.
3. **Neither tool is available**: this is a genuine setup defect, not a routing decision — HARD STOP, post a PR/issue comment explaining that no sub-agent dispatch tool is available, add `needs-human`, and exit without posting a verdict. Do NOT fall back to reviewing inline in the orchestrator's own context.
4. **Dispatch pool exhausted or dispatch call fails**: this is not tool absence. If any Bug Hunter, quality, domain, material-change, or regression reviewer cannot be launched because the sub-agent pool/session limit is exhausted (or any dispatch call fails), HARD STOP. Do not substitute inline review or silently continue with a partial panel. Mark the PR `review-degraded`, post `<!-- FORGE:GATE_FAILURE:TYPE=review-panel-integrity -->` with the selected and completed counts, and exit without a deploy verdict. A fresh session must re-run the full panel.

**Do not halt to ask the operator which tool to use.** Steps 1–2 are deterministic and fully resolve the common case; only step 3 (both absent) requires a stop, and even then the action is HARD STOP + `needs-human`, not a question back to the operator.

Everywhere this file says `Task(...)`, read it as `{DISPATCH_TOOL}(...)` using the value resolved here.

## Forbidden Tools Self-Check

**Before executing any phase**, verify you are NOT using any of these:

| Tool/Pattern | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `Agent`, when `Task` is available | **FORBIDDEN** | `Task` is preferred whenever present — `Agent` is only the fallback for when `Task` is absent, not a free substitute |
| Inline self-review (no sub-agent spawn at all) | **FORBIDDEN** | Bypasses isolated fresh-context review entirely — always spawn via the resolved `{DISPATCH_TOOL}`, never review directly in the orchestrator's own context |
| `EnterPlanMode` | **FORBIDDEN** | Breaks execution context; phases must be executed, not planned |

If you find yourself about to call `Agent(...)` while `Task` is available, stop and use `Task(...)` instead. If neither `Task` nor `Agent` is available, do not fall through to inline review — follow step 3 of Sub-Agent Dispatch Tool Resolution above.

---

## Config Resolution

Read `forge.yaml` to resolve branch names before running any commands:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE="${FORGE_CONFIG:-forge.yaml}"
GH_REPO=$(yq '.project.owner + "/" + .project.repo' "$CONFIG_FILE")
GH_FLAG="-R $GH_REPO"
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(yq '.branches.default' "$CONFIG_FILE")
STAGING_BRANCH=$(yq '.branches.staging' "$CONFIG_FILE")

# Test-gate config (Phase 6.5) — read here so vars are available before first use
GATE_POSTURE=$(yq '.verification.test_gate.posture // "blocking"' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "blocking")
OVERRIDE_PHRASE=$(yq '.verification.test_gate.override_phrase // "OVERRIDE: shipping with test failures —"' "$CONFIG_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "OVERRIDE: shipping with test failures —")
```

All `$DEFAULT_BRANCH`, `$STAGING_BRANCH`, `$GATE_POSTURE`, and `$OVERRIDE_PHRASE` references below are populated from `forge.yaml`.

---

## Review Protocol Reference

<!-- FORGE:PROTOCOL_SOURCE — canonical definition lives in docs/spec/review-protocol.md -->

The **Evidence-Based Review Protocol** and **Structured Findings Protocol** are defined in `docs/spec/review-protocol.md`. All agents spawned by this spec MUST follow both protocols as specified there. The full protocol text is embedded in `commands/review-pr-agents.md` for agent use.

**Key protocol rules (summary — see `docs/spec/review-protocol.md` for the normative definition)**:
- Start from the diff. Follow imports. Trace data flows across service boundaries.
- Confidence levels: CONFIRMED (full code-path proof, P1) → LIKELY (pattern + caveat, P2) → POSSIBLE (advisory, P3) → UNFOUNDED (do not report)
- REPRODUCTION GATE: CONFIRMED requires a full code-path trace or concrete input demonstration
- Severity: runtime error → HIGH/CRITICAL; wrong data silently → HIGH; degraded perf → MEDIUM; cosmetic → LOW
- INTERACTION ANALYSIS: never dismiss as "pre-existing" without checking NEW code interactions
- FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION: trace scope, types, callers before reporting
- Structured findings block MANDATORY at end of every agent comment

---

## Phase -1: Route Assertion

**This phase is MANDATORY and must execute before Phase 0A. No phase may be skipped.**

**Idempotent re-review (merge-train aware)**: <!-- Added: forge#1328, extended: forge#1332 --> This spec is safe to invoke multiple times on the same PR. Each invocation posts a new `FORGE:REVIEW_ROUTE` marker with the current SHA — re-review passes are distinguished by SHA, not by PR number. When a staging→main deploy PR receives blocking findings and the fixes are pushed to the head branch, re-invoke this spec on the same PR number. Do NOT close the PR and create a new one.

**Prior-finding awareness on re-entry**: On each re-invocation, load findings from prior review passes on the same PR before running any new checks. Previously-resolved findings (issues that are now closed or marked `false-positive`) are excluded from the current verdict to avoid re-surfacing already-fixed issues. Previously-unresolved findings (open issues from a prior pass) are carried forward as context so agents know what was previously flagged:

```bash
# Load prior FORGE:REVIEW_ROUTE comments to detect re-entry
PRIOR_ROUTES=$(gh api repos/${GH_REPO}/issues/${PR_NUMBER}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.body | test("FORGE:REVIEW_ROUTE")) | .body] | length' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)

IS_REENTRY=0
if [ "$PRIOR_ROUTES" -gt 0 ]; then
  IS_REENTRY=1
  echo "Re-entry detected: $PRIOR_ROUTES prior review pass(es) on PR #${PR_NUMBER}"

  # Load findings from prior passes that are still open
  PRIOR_OPEN_FINDINGS=$(gh issue list ${GH_FLAG} \
    --label "review-finding" \
    --state open \
    --search "PR #${PR_NUMBER}" \
    --limit 50 \
    --json number,title,labels \
    --jq '.[] | "  - #\(.number): \(.title)"' 2>/dev/null || true)

  # Load findings that were resolved (closed) since the last pass
  PRIOR_RESOLVED_FINDINGS=$(gh issue list ${GH_FLAG} \
    --label "review-finding" \
    --state closed \
    --search "PR #${PR_NUMBER}" \
    --limit 50 \
    --json number,title \
    --jq '.[] | "  - #\(.number): \(.title)"' 2>/dev/null || true)

  echo "Prior open findings (carry forward): $(echo "$PRIOR_OPEN_FINDINGS" | grep -c '.' || echo 0)"
  echo "Prior resolved findings (exclude from verdict): $(echo "$PRIOR_RESOLVED_FINDINGS" | grep -c '.' || echo 0)"
fi
```

Agents receive `$IS_REENTRY`, `$PRIOR_OPEN_FINDINGS`, and `$PRIOR_RESOLVED_FINDINGS` as context. They MUST NOT re-file issues that already exist in `$PRIOR_OPEN_FINDINGS` (dedup gate in Phase 7 covers this). Resolved findings do NOT contribute to the BLOCK verdict for the current pass.

Resolve the staging→main PR number and post a routing marker immediately. This creates an audit trail — if a staging→main PR has no `FORGE:REVIEW_ROUTE` comment after this command was invoked, the review was bypassed or never started.

```bash
# Resolve PR_NUMBER from $ARGUMENTS
# $ARGUMENTS may be: a PR number, "staging", "feature", or "staging:feature"
if echo "$ARGUMENTS" | grep -qE '^[0-9]+$'; then
  PR_NUMBER="$ARGUMENTS"
else
  # Find the open staging→main PR
  PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list ${GH_FLAG} \
    --head "$STAGING_BRANCH" \
    --base "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" \
    --state open \
    --json number \
    --jq '.[0].number' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
fi

REVIEW_SHA_STAGING=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" ${GH_FLAG} --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid' 2>/dev/null | cut -c1-7 || echo "n/a")

if [ -n "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" ${GH_FLAG} --body "<!-- FORGE:REVIEW_ROUTE mode=staging-deploy spec=review-pr-staging.md sha=${REVIEW_SHA_STAGING} -->"
else
  echo "WARNING: Could not resolve staging→main PR number. FORGE:REVIEW_ROUTE marker not posted."
fi
```

`$PR_NUMBER` is now set for all downstream phases that conditionally post gate comments to the PR.

---

## Phase 0A: Open Review-Finding Gate (BLOCKING — runs before scope analysis)

**Purpose**: Prevent deploying commits that have known, unfixed review findings. The review system catches bugs before merging; this gate ensures the merge path acts on that information.

**Why this matters**: Review findings are filed before the originating PR merges to staging. Without this gate, a staging→main bundle can include commits with known unfixed bugs — the review system caught the issue, but the deploy path ignored it. This gate closes the gap between issue discovery and deploy execution. <!-- Added: forge#303 -->

```bash
git fetch origin $DEFAULT_BRANCH $STAGING_BRANCH

# Step 1: Resolve all PRs in the staging→main bundle by the packaged resolver's
# frozen commit-graph reachability contract. Never infer membership from commit
# subjects, issue references, or PR numbers in prose.
#
# The resolver accepts GitHub PR identity plus head/merge commit evidence. A candidate
# contributes when one of those commits is reachable from frozen staging but not from
# frozen main, which handles merge, squash, and rebase merges without subject parsing.
BUNDLE_CANDIDATES=$(gh api --paginate \
  "repos/${GH_REPO}/pulls?state=all&base=${STAGING_BRANCH}&per_page=100" \

Fix the open findings above and merge fixes to staging before retrying the staging→main deploy.
To override (ship known issues with documented reason), post a comment starting with:

<!-- FORGE:GATE_FAILURE:TYPE=open-review-finding|FINDINGS=${FINDING_COUNT} -->" 2>/dev/null || true
    fi

fi
```

If the gate exits with `RESULT: BLOCK DEPLOY` → **STOP**. Do NOT proceed to Phase 0B or any downstream phases. A `<!-- FORGE:GATE_FAILURE -->` structured comment is automatically posted on the staging→main PR (if `$PR_NUMBER` is set) for pipeline-health tracking. Report the blocking finding list.

If the gate exits with `RESULT: PASS` → a `<!-- FORGE:GATE_PASS -->` structured comment is posted on the staging→main PR so that `/pipeline-health` can distinguish a clean gate from a silently skipped one. A PR with no gate comment at all indicates a gate bypass — not a clean pass.

---

## Phase 0B: Scope Analysis

```bash
git fetch origin $DEFAULT_BRANCH $STAGING_BRANCH
git diff origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH...origin/$STAGING_BRANCH --stat | tail -20
git diff origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH...origin/$STAGING_BRANCH --numstat | awk '{add+=$1; del+=$2} END {print "Added:", add, "Deleted:", del, "Total:", add+del}'
git diff origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH...origin/$STAGING_BRANCH --name-only | sort | uniq
```

Categorize by service (API, Worker, Web, Shared, Infra). Identify high-risk files (billing, credits, pricing, auth, security, migration, scraper).

Create review chunks by priority: Billing/Pricing (CRITICAL) → Security/Auth (CRITICAL) → Scraper Core (HIGH) → API Routers (HIGH) → Worker (HIGH) → Web (MEDIUM) → Shared (MEDIUM) → Infra (MEDIUM) → Other (LOW).

---

## Phase 1: Automated Checks

### 1A: Python Linting

Read `forge.yaml → verification.commands.python` for project-specific tool commands:

```bash
PYTHON_FORMAT=$(yq '.verification.commands.python.format // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
PYTHON_LINT=$(yq '.verification.commands.python.lint // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')

if [ -n "$PYTHON_FORMAT" ]; then
    eval "$PYTHON_FORMAT" 2>&1 | head -30
else
    echo "SKIPPED — python.format not configured in verification.commands"
fi

if [ -n "$PYTHON_LINT" ]; then
    eval "$PYTHON_LINT" 2>&1 | head -30
else
    echo "SKIPPED — python.lint not configured in verification.commands"
fi
```

### 1B: TypeScript Type-Check + Build (MANDATORY)

Read `forge.yaml → verification.commands.typescript` for project-specific tool commands:

```bash
TS_TYPECHECK=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.typecheck // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
TS_BUILD=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.build // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')

if [ -n "$TS_TYPECHECK" ]; then
    eval "$TS_TYPECHECK" 2>&1
    TS_EXIT=$?
    [ "$TS_EXIT" -ne 0 ] && echo "BLOCKING: typecheck failed — deploy WILL fail"
else
    echo "SKIPPED — typescript.typecheck not configured in verification.commands"
    TS_EXIT=0
fi

if [ -n "$TS_BUILD" ]; then
    eval "$TS_BUILD" 2>&1 | tail -50
    BUILD_EXIT=$?
    [ "$BUILD_EXIT" -ne 0 ] && echo "BLOCKING: build failed — deploy WILL fail"
else
    echo "SKIPPED — typescript.build not configured in verification.commands"
fi
```
Build failure is BLOCKING — deploy WILL fail. Typecheck alone misses SSG/prerender failures — configure `typescript.build` in `verification.commands`.

### 1C: Python Tests

Read `forge.yaml → verification.commands.python.test`:

```bash
PYTHON_TEST=$(yq '.verification.commands.python.test // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')

if [ -n "$PYTHON_TEST" ]; then
    eval "$PYTHON_TEST" 2>&1 | tail -50
else
    echo "SKIPPED — python.test not configured in verification.commands"
fi
```

### 1D: Secrets Scan
```bash
git diff origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH...origin/$STAGING_BRANCH | grep -iE "(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token|credential)" | grep -vE "(#|//|\.example|placeholder)" | head -20
```

### 1E: CI Status Gate (BLOCKING)
```bash
gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER} 2>&1
```
Any CI failure → BLOCK DEPLOY (unless autofixed in Phase 1F).

### Phase 1F: CI Autofix

If CI fails, attempt automatic fix before blocking:

| Failure Pattern | Category | Autofixable? |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
| Black/isort formatting | FORMATTING | Yes |
| Type error in next build | TYPE_ERROR | Yes |
| Module not found | IMPORT_ERROR | Yes |
| Prerender error | PRERENDER | Maybe |
| Test assertion failure | TEST_FAILURE | No |
| Infrastructure flake | FLAKE | No |

For fixable failures: checkout staging, apply fix, verify locally, commit as `fix(ci): ...`, push, wait for CI re-run (max 10 min). Max 1 autofix attempt. If it fails → BLOCK DEPLOY.

---

## Phase 2: Material Change Analysis

Launch agent (model: {SUBAGENT_MODEL}) to analyze all commits since last deploy. Categorize as: NEW FEATURE, ENHANCEMENT, BUG FIX, REFACTOR, SECURITY, PERFORMANCE, INFRASTRUCTURE, DEPENDENCY. Separate user-facing vs internal. Document breaking changes and required pre-deploy actions.

**MANDATORY — post findings as PR comment**: Before its first post attempt, the agent MUST persist the final report to a uniquely named durable file, then post it with `--body-file`. It MUST also return verdict, finding count, and one line per finding to the orchestrator whether the post succeeds or fails; on failure, return the file path and stop without retrying. After completing analysis, the agent posts its full report directly to the PR:
```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} -R ${GH_REPO} --body "<!-- FORGE:REVIEW-AGENT:material-change -->
## Material Change Analysis

[full analysis report here]

<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-START -->
<!-- FINDING:... -->
<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-END -->"
```
Include the structured `<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-START -->` block even if there are no findings (empty block). This ensures auditability even if the orchestrator crashes mid-review. <!-- Added: forge#1400 -->

---

## Phase 3: Bug Hunter Review (Per-Service)

Launch Bug Hunter agents for each service with changes:

**API Bug Hunter** (services/api/): Logic errors, error handling, type issues, resource leaks, state issues, auth bugs, data flow tracing. Prefix: BUG/AUTH.

**Worker Bug Hunter** (services/worker/): Job processing bugs, queue issues, tier escalation, reconciliation errors, scraping logic, async issues, Cortex integration. Prefix: BUG/SCRP/CONC.

**Web Bug Hunter** (web/src/): React issues (keys, closures, hydration), data fetching, security (XSS), UX, build-breaking patterns, type issues. Prefix: FE.

Each reads the service diff, hunts for bugs, traces context across imports, persists its finalized report before posting, and returns its verdict and findings independently of GitHub delivery.

**MANDATORY — each Bug Hunter agent MUST post its findings directly to the PR immediately upon completion** (do not wait for the orchestrator to batch-post):
```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} -R ${GH_REPO} --body "<!-- FORGE:REVIEW-AGENT:bug-hunter-{service} -->
## Bug Hunter Review — {service}

[full findings here]

<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-START -->
<!-- FINDING:BUG-N|CONFIDENCE|SEVERITY|file:line|summary -->
<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-END -->"
```
Where `{service}` is `api`, `worker`, or `web`. Post one comment per service agent. <!-- Added: forge#1400 -->

---

## Phase 4: Code Quality Review

Agent hunts for: dead code, duplicate logic, complexity (>50 line functions), naming issues, missing abstractions, logging quality, magic numbers. Prefix: QA.

**MANDATORY — post findings as PR comment**: Before its first post attempt, the agent MUST persist the final report to a uniquely named durable file, then post it with `--body-file`. It MUST also return verdict, finding count, and one line per finding to the orchestrator whether the post succeeds or fails; on failure, return the file path and stop without retrying. After completing analysis, the agent posts its full report directly to the PR:
```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} -R ${GH_REPO} --body "<!-- FORGE:REVIEW-AGENT:code-quality -->
## Code Quality Review

[full analysis here]

<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-START -->
<!-- FINDING:QA-N|CONFIDENCE|SEVERITY|file:line|summary -->
<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-END -->"
```
<!-- Added: forge#1400 -->

---

## Phase 5: Security & Billing Deep Dive

**MANDATORY TEMPLATE-RESOLUTION GUARD — run BEFORE reading the agent catalog:**

Missing persona templates are a fatal setup error, not permission to skip multi-agent review. Resolve the template source through this ordered chain (identical to the one used by `/review-pr` Phase 3C — do not diverge) and STOP if none resolve — never fall through to reviewing inline in the main context:

```bash
TEMPLATE_BASE=""
if [[ -f "$FORGE_HOME/commands/review-pr-agents/protocols.md" ]]; then
  TEMPLATE_BASE="$FORGE_HOME/commands/review-pr-agents"
  TEMPLATE_SOURCE="forge_home"
else
  FORGE_YAML="${FORGE_CONFIG:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)/forge.yaml}"
  REPO_PATH=$(yq '.paths.root' "$FORGE_YAML" 2>/dev/null || git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
  if [[ -f "$REPO_PATH/commands/review-pr-agents/protocols.md" ]]; then

  # HARD STOP — post error, add needs-human, do NOT review
fi
```

**If `TEMPLATE_SOURCE` is `none`**: HARD STOP. Post a PR comment explaining the setup is broken, instructing the user to run `npx forgedock update` to repair the install, add `needs-human`, and exit without posting any findings or a verdict. **NEVER perform the review inline in the main agent context as a substitute.**

**If `TEMPLATE_SOURCE` is `forge_home` or `repo_path`** (normal cases — behavior unchanged): `Read: $TEMPLATE_BASE/protocols.md` and `Read: $TEMPLATE_BASE/<persona>.md` per selected agent.

**If `TEMPLATE_SOURCE` is `monolithic_catalog`** (last resort): `Read: $MONOLITHIC_CATALOG` and extract the shared protocols section plus each selected persona's section from within that single file.

Launch domain-specific agents based on which domains have changes. Substitute PR diff commands with staging diff commands. Agents: General Security (always), Auth, Billing, Concurrency, Scraper, API Design, Database, Infrastructure.

**MANDATORY — each domain agent MUST persist its finalized body before posting its findings directly to the PR immediately upon completion** (not batched by the orchestrator). It MUST return verdict, finding count, and one line per finding to the orchestrator independently of delivery; if posting fails, return the durable file path and stop without retrying:
```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} -R ${GH_REPO} --body "<!-- FORGE:REVIEW-AGENT:{domain} -->
## {Domain} Review

[full analysis here]

<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-START -->
<!-- FINDING:{PREFIX}-N|CONFIDENCE|SEVERITY|file:line|summary -->
<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-END -->"
```
Where `{domain}` is `security`, `auth`, `billing`, `concurrency`, `scraper`, `api-design`, `database`, or `infrastructure`. Post one comment per domain agent. This ensures findings are posted even if the orchestrator crashes mid-review. <!-- Added: forge#1400 -->

---

## Phase 6: Regression Risk Assessment

Agent maps dependencies, assesses integration points (service boundaries, env vars, Docker changes, workflow sibling drift between ci.yml and deploy-production.yml), evaluates rollback difficulty (easy/hard/destructive/state-dependent), checks test coverage. Posts risk matrix with rollback plan. Prefix: REG.

**MANDATORY — post findings as PR comment**: Before its first post attempt, the agent MUST persist the final report to a uniquely named durable file, then post it with `--body-file`. It MUST also return verdict, finding count, and one line per finding to the orchestrator whether the post succeeds or fails; on failure, return the file path and stop without retrying. After completing analysis, the agent posts its full report directly to the PR:
```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUMBER} -R ${GH_REPO} --body "<!-- FORGE:REVIEW-AGENT:regression-risk -->
## Regression Risk Assessment

[full risk matrix and rollback plan here]

<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-START -->
<!-- FINDING:REG-N|CONFIDENCE|SEVERITY|file:line|summary -->
<!-- REVIEW-FINDINGS-END -->"
```
<!-- Added: forge#1400 -->

**Workflow sibling drift (MANDATORY)**: Deep-diff ci.yml and deploy-production.yml shared jobs. Compare PYTHONPATH, dependency install steps, step names. Pre-existing drift is invisible until deploy fails.

**Database container restart risk (MANDATORY when `docker-compose*.yml` changes touch `postgres` or `redis` service)**: Any change to a stateful container's `command:`, `image:`, `volumes:`, or `environment:` forces container recreation on deploy. Auto-escalate to HIGH risk. Verify: `stop_grace_period` is sufficient (≥30s for PG), `full_page_writes = on`, `fsync = on`, no active long-running transactions will be interrupted. Recommend maintenance window — stateful container restarts must NOT happen as a side effect of routine deploys. A Postgres restart under active write load can corrupt btree indexes and bypass UNIQUE constraints. <!-- Added: forge#146 -->

---

## Phase 6.5: Runtime Test Gate (BLOCKING — runs after static analysis, before finding triage)

**Purpose**: Verify the integrated bundle's acceptance criteria against running code before the deploy verdict. Catches runtime defects (cross-PR interactions, container/startup failures, regression in tested behaviour) that static review cannot surface.

**Why here**: Phase 6 completes all static analysis (regression risk, security, quality). Phase 6.5 adds the runtime dimension before Phase 7 triages findings — so any test-gate failures can be filed as `test-failure` issues by `/test-gate` itself, then surface in Phase 7's triage pass.

**Posture**: Controlled by `verification.test_gate.posture` in `forge.yaml` (resolved in Config Resolution as `$GATE_POSTURE`). Default: `blocking`. Set to `advisory` to surface failures without preventing deploy. <!-- Added: forge#906 -->

```bash
echo "=== Phase 6.5: Runtime Test Gate ==="
echo "Bundle PRs: $(echo $ALL_PR_NUMBERS | tr '\n' ' ')"
echo "Posture: ${GATE_POSTURE}"

# Initialize test-gate verdict (default SKIP — safe if Phase 6.5 is bypassed)
TEST_GATE_VERDICT="SKIP"
TEST_GATE_REASON="Phase 6.5 not yet run"

# Invoke /test-gate with the bundle PRs already computed in Phase 0A
# ALL_PR_NUMBERS is the de-duplicated set resolved by frozen commit-graph reachability
GATE_OUTPUT=$(Skill("test-gate", "--prs \"$(echo $ALL_PR_NUMBERS | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs)\" --base $DEFAULT_BRANCH"))

# Extract machine-readable verdict from Skill output
TEST_GATE_VERDICT=$(echo "$GATE_OUTPUT" | grep -oP '(?<=FORGE:TEST_GATE:RESULT=)(BLOCK|PASS|SKIP)' | tail -1 || echo "SKIP")

echo "Test-gate verdict: ${TEST_GATE_VERDICT}"
```

**Verdict handling**:

```bash
case "$TEST_GATE_VERDICT" in

  SKIP)
    echo "ℹ️  Test gate: SKIP — no executable changes or tests not configured."
    echo "   This gap will appear in the Phase 8 summary. No deploy impact."

## Deploy Gate: BLOCKED

**Gate**: test-gate
**Timestamp**: ${GATE_TIMESTAMP}
**Bundle PRs**: $(echo $ALL_PR_NUMBERS | tr '\n' ' ')
**Posture**: ${GATE_POSTURE}

### What Happened

\`/test-gate\` detected runtime failures in the staging→\`${DEFAULT_BRANCH}\` bundle that were NOT present on the \`${DEFAULT_BRANCH}\` baseline. These are batch-introduced regressions.

\`/test-gate\` has filed \`test-failure\` issues for each failing cluster — check the issue tracker for details.

### Resolution

1. Fix the failing tests and merge fixes to staging.
2. Retry the staging→\`${DEFAULT_BRANCH}\` deploy.

To override (ship known failures with documented reason), post a comment containing:
\`${OVERRIDE_PHRASE} <reason>\`

<!-- FORGE:GATE_FAILURE:TYPE=test-gate|BUNDLE=$(echo $ALL_PR_NUMBERS | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs) -->" 2>/dev/null || true
      fi
      exit 1
    fi
    ;;

  *)
    echo "⚠️  Test gate: unrecognised verdict '${TEST_GATE_VERDICT}' — treating as SKIP."
    TEST_GATE_VERDICT="SKIP"
    TEST_GATE_REASON="SKIP — unrecognised verdict from /test-gate (treated as SKIP)"
    ;;

esac
```

If the gate exits with `RESULT: BLOCK DEPLOY` → **STOP**. A `<!-- FORGE:GATE_FAILURE -->` structured comment is automatically posted on the staging→main PR (if `$PR_NUMBER` is set) for pipeline-health tracking. `/test-gate` will have filed `test-failure` issues for each failing cluster before returning BLOCK.

---

**Incomplete-panel guard (MANDATORY):** Increment `SELECTED_AGENT_COUNT` for every reviewer selected across Phases 2–6 before launching it. If any dispatch fails, set `DISPATCH_FAILED=true`. Before Phase 7, count unique `FORGE:REVIEW-AGENT` markers. If the completed count is lower than selected, follow the same hard-stop path as pool exhaustion: create `review-degraded` if needed, label the PR, post `FORGE:GATE_FAILURE`, and exit. Do not create a deploy verdict from partial reviewer output.

```bash
ACTUAL_AGENT_COUNT=$(gh api "repos/${GH_REPO}/issues/${PR_NUMBER}/comments" \
  --jq '[.[].body | scan("<!-- FORGE:REVIEW-AGENT:([a-z-]+) -->") | .[0]] | unique | length' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
if [ "$DISPATCH_FAILED" = "true" ] || [ "$ACTUAL_AGENT_COUNT" -lt "$SELECTED_AGENT_COUNT" ]; then
  gh label create "review-degraded" --color "E4E669" --description "PR review panel was incomplete; re-review required before deployment. Managed by ForgeDock." --force -R "$GH_REPO" 2>/dev/null || true
  gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" -R "$GH_REPO" --add-label "review-degraded" --add-label "needs-human" 2>/dev/null || true # allowlist:check-command-side-effects
  gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" -R "$GH_REPO" --body "<!-- FORGE:GATE_FAILURE:TYPE=review-panel-integrity -->
## Deploy Review Blocked: Incomplete Isolated Review Panel

**Selected isolated reviewers**: ${SELECTED_AGENT_COUNT}
**Completed isolated reviewers**: ${ACTUAL_AGENT_COUNT}

Re-run the full staging review in a fresh session before deployment."
  exit 1
fi
```

## Phase 7: Finding Triage & Issue Creation

### Phase 6.75: Verify Agent Delivery

Before launching every Phase 2-6 review agent, append its lowercase marker domain (for example, `security`, `bug-hunter-api`, or `regression-risk`) to `LAUNCHED_REVIEW_AGENTS`. A completed agent is accounted for only when its corresponding marker comment is present on the PR.

```bash
MISSING_AGENT_COMMENTS=""
for AGENT_DOMAIN in $LAUNCHED_REVIEW_AGENTS; do
  AGENT_COMMENT_COUNT=$(gh api "repos/${GH_REPO}/issues/${PR_NUMBER}/comments" \
    --jq "[.[] | select(.body | contains(\"<!-- FORGE:REVIEW-AGENT:${AGENT_DOMAIN} -->\"))] | length" \
    2>/dev/null || printf '0')
  if [ "${AGENT_COMMENT_COUNT:-0}" -lt 1 ]; then
    MISSING_AGENT_COMMENTS="${MISSING_AGENT_COMMENTS} ${AGENT_DOMAIN}"
  fi
done

if [ -n "$MISSING_AGENT_COMMENTS" ]; then
  echo "REVIEW DELIVERY FAILURE: missing findings comment(s) for:${MISSING_AGENT_COMMENTS}"
  echo "Recover each agent's returned verdict, findings, and durable body path before rerunning review."
  exit 1
fi
```

Missing comments are an explicit failure, never evidence of no findings. Do not triage or synthesize a deploy verdict while any launched agent is unaccounted for.

### 7A: Extract Findings
From PR comments, extract structured findings (`<!-- FINDING:... -->`). If none found, scan for unstructured findings. If still 0 → skip to Phase 8.

### 7B: Filter & Deduplicate
Keep ALL findings (CONFIRMED/LIKELY/POSSIBLE). Deduplicate by file:line (keep higher confidence). Sort: CONFIRMED first, then by severity.

### 7C: Ensure Labels
```bash
# Colors match the canonical ForgeDock label manifest (bin/labels.json).
# Run `npx forgedock labels setup` to bootstrap all managed labels at once.
gh label create "review-finding" --color "D93F0B" --description "Defect or improvement found during automated PR review. Managed by ForgeDock." --force -R {GH_REPO} 2>/dev/null
gh label create "needs-validation" --color "FBCA04" --description "Review finding awaiting human validation. Managed by ForgeDock." --force -R {GH_REPO} 2>/dev/null
gh label create "staging-review" --color "1D76DB" --description "Finding from a staging branch review before deploy to main. Managed by ForgeDock." --force -R {GH_REPO} 2>/dev/null
```

### 7D: Milestone & Code Branch Detection

Derive both `CODE_BRANCH` and `MILESTONE_FLAG` from the reviewed PR before creating any findings. Unlike `commands/review-pr.md` (feature-lane PRs with short-lived HEAD branches that get deleted post-merge — see the rationale comment on that spec's finding template), `review-pr-staging.md` reviews long-lived branches (`staging`, `milestone/*`) that persist after merge, so `CODE_BRANCH` uses `headRefName` (the PR's HEAD — the branch actually being reviewed), consistent with forge#1391's original fix. This replaces the previous hardcoded `staging` literal, which was silently wrong whenever this spec reviewed a `milestone/X → staging` PR instead of a `staging → main` PR — `CODE_BRANCH` used to always say `staging` even when the reviewed branch was `milestone/X`.

```bash
CODE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')
MILESTONE_FLAG=""

# scripts/derive-finding-milestone.sh is the single source of truth for
# milestone derivation — commands/review-pr.md and commands/review-pr-staging.md
# both call it identically so the two specs cannot independently drift.
# <!-- forge#2443 -->
MILESTONE_TITLE=$(bash scripts/derive-finding-milestone.sh "${PR_NUMBER}" -R {GH_REPO})
# Quoted so multi-word milestone titles survive as a single value wherever
# MILESTONE_FLAG is later interpolated — matches the quoting convention already
# used for --title/--body-file/--label below.
[ -n "$MILESTONE_TITLE" ] && MILESTONE_FLAG="--milestone \"$MILESTONE_TITLE\""
```

Plain staging→main reviews resolve `CODE_BRANCH` to `staging` dynamically (same value as before, now derived rather than hardcoded) and typically resolve no milestone. A milestone→staging review resolves `CODE_BRANCH` to `milestone/X` and (via the shared script) the matching milestone.

### 7E: Deduplicate Against Existing Issues
Check for open review-finding issues at same file:line → skip. Closed issues at same location → potential regression (elevate priority).

### 7F: Create Issues
Sequential creation. Title: `fix: {summary} (staging review — PR #{PR_NUMBER})`. Labels: review-finding, needs-validation, staging-review, priority:P0-P3 (derived from Severity — see below). Body includes: source branch context (`${CODE_BRANCH}`, derived in Phase 7D — not a hardcoded `staging` literal), code context, evidence, validation checklist.

**For each finding** (that passes dedup), create issue through the `/issue` create-hook's programmatic invocation contract (see `commands/issue.md` § "Programmatic Invocation Contract") instead of calling the raw issue-creation command directly:
```bash
STAGING_FINDING_TITLE="fix: [summary] (staging review — PR #${PR_NUMBER})"
# Defense-in-depth: /issue's arg tokenizer (commands/issue.md, forge#2094) uses
# an xargs-based tokenizer that never expands backtick/$(...) substitution, so
# this is no longer required for safety — but strip it anyway so the raw title
# stays readable if it round-trips through any other eval-based consumer.
STAGING_FINDING_TITLE=$(printf '%s' "$STAGING_FINDING_TITLE" | tr '`' "'" | sed 's/\$(/$ (/g')
SCRATCHPAD="${FORGE_SCRATCHPAD:-$PWD/.forge-scratch}"
REVIEW_AGENT_TOKEN="${AGENT_ID:-${HOSTNAME:-reviewer}-$$}"
mkdir -p "$SCRATCHPAD"
STAGING_FINDING_BODY_MARKER="FORGE:BODY-INTEGRITY:${PR_NUMBER}_staging-review_${REVIEW_AGENT_TOKEN}"
STAGING_FINDING_BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$SCRATCHPAD/${PR_NUMBER}_staging-review_${REVIEW_AGENT_TOKEN}.XXXXXX.md")
cat <<'ISSUE_EOF' > "$STAGING_FINDING_BODY_FILE"
## Problem

[One sentence: what bug or issue was found. Where it occurs (`file:line`) and what it causes.]

**Source**: PR #[PR_NUMBER] — [TITLE]
**Confidence**: [CONFIRMED/LIKELY/POSSIBLE]
**Severity**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Review comment**: [permalink to agent comment]

## Root Cause

[Verified mechanical cause, or: "Unverified review hypothesis: ...". Never present reviewer inference as established fact.]

## Affected Files

Candidate investigation starting points (not mutation authority):
1. `[file:line]` — [why investigation should begin here]

## Source Branch Context

**Code branch**: `[CODE_BRANCH]`
**Worktree base**: `origin/[CODE_BRANCH]`

> When fixing: `git worktree add ../fix-{slug} -b fix/{slug} origin/[CODE_BRANCH]`

## Code Context
[10 lines around finding]

## Evidence
[From agent comment]

## Expected Behavior

[Observable invariant or behavior that must hold if investigation validates the finding.]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Finding validated: VALIDATED / FALSE_POSITIVE / INCONCLUSIVE
- [ ] If VALIDATED: fix implemented and tested on correct branch

Labels: `review-finding` + `needs-validation` + `staging-review` + priority. `priority:*` is derived from the finding's `**Severity**` field via `scripts/severity-to-priority.sh` (identical script used by `commands/review-pr.md` — single documented mapping, see that script's header comment): `CRITICAL` → `priority:P0`, `HIGH` → `priority:P1`, `MEDIUM` → `priority:P2`, `LOW` → `priority:P3`. **Never derive `priority:*` from Confidence** (CONFIRMED/LIKELY/POSSIBLE) — conflating the two axes previously mislabeled LOW-severity CONFIRMED findings as `priority:P1`, defeating orchestrate's P3 batching rule. <!-- forge#2447 -->

**No pre-filtering**: Every finding becomes an issue. Validation agents sort out false positives downstream.

## Phase 8: Final Summary & Deployment Checklist

Post summary with verdict:
1. CI failed + autofix failed → BLOCK DEPLOY
2. CI failed + autofix succeeded → continue
2.5. Test gate returned BLOCK (blocking posture, no override) → BLOCK DEPLOY *(handled in Phase 6.5 — if Phase 8 is reached, BLOCK was either overridden or posture is advisory)*
3. CONFIRMED CRITICAL (non-CI) → BLOCK DEPLOY
4. CONFIRMED HIGH blocking (crashes, data loss) → NEEDS FIXES FIRST
5. All else → APPROVE FOR DEPLOY

Include: Material Changes Summary, Risk Matrix (CI, Build, Bugs, Security, Billing, Quality, Regression, **Test Gate**), Finding Triage Results, Blocking Issues, Deployment Checklist (pre-deploy, deploy, post-deploy verification, rollback triggers), Stats.

**Risk Matrix must include a Test Gate row** (use `$TEST_GATE_VERDICT` and `$TEST_GATE_REASON` set in Phase 6.5):

| Domain | Result | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| CI | ... | ... |
| Build | ... | ... |
| Bugs | ... | ... |
| Security | ... | ... |
| Billing | ... | ... |
| Quality | ... | ... |
| Regression | ... | ... |
| **Test Gate** | `${TEST_GATE_VERDICT:-SKIP}` | `${TEST_GATE_REASON:-Phase 6.5 not run}` |

If `TEST_GATE_VERDICT` is `SKIP`, surface the gap explicitly in the summary:

> **Test Gate: SKIP** — No runtime tests ran for this bundle. This means acceptance criteria were NOT verified against running code before deploy. Cause: `${TEST_GATE_REASON}`. To enable runtime testing, configure `verification.integration_tests` in `forge.yaml`.

If `TEST_GATE_VERDICT` is `PASS`, note it as a positive signal:

> **Test Gate: PASS** — Acceptance criteria verified against running code. No batch-introduced runtime failures detected.

If `TEST_GATE_VERDICT` is `BLOCK` and Phase 8 was reached (advisory posture or override active), note it as a risk:

> **Test Gate: BLOCK (override/advisory)** — Runtime failures were detected but deploy is proceeding. Reason: `${TEST_GATE_REASON}`. Filed `test-failure` issues track the failures.

**CRITICAL**: This review NEVER merges staging → main. User makes deploy decision via GitHub web UI.

---

## Gate Marker Contract

Every completed staging review MUST leave one of the following structured markers on the PR:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `<!-- FORGE:GATE_PASS -->` | Gate ran and passed — deploy may proceed |
| `<!-- FORGE:GATE_FAILURE -->` | Gate ran and blocked — do NOT deploy |

**Absence of both markers = bypass detected.** The `.github/workflows/gate-marker-check.yml` workflow enforces this: it scans the PR timeline after review completes and fails CI if no gate marker is present within 30 minutes of the PR being opened/updated. A missing marker is treated as a deploy blocker — not a pass.

This symmetry closes the silent-bypass gap identified in forge#1387: previously, gate PASS posted nothing, making a clean pass indistinguishable from a skipped spec.
