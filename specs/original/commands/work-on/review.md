# work-on/review — Review & PR Creation Subcommand

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

**Invoked by**: `work-on.md` Phase 4–5, after `build/validate.md` returns `GATE_PASSED: true`.
**Output**: Push branch, create PR, invoke /review-pr --auto-merge, return result to caller.

**Agent model policy**: `model: "{DEFAULT_MODEL}"` — resolved from forge.yaml `agents.default_model`, else "sonnet" (standard tier). Fallback: `model: "opus"` if rate-limited. Feature gate: pass `effort` in Task/Skill spawns only on Claude Code >= 2.1.154. This file's mechanical bits (label transitions, `FORGE:CHECKPOINT` writes) stay at this tier because they're interleaved with the review/merge-decision steps in the same `Skill()` invocation — see `work-on.md` section "Model and Effort Tiering — What Actually Applies". <!-- Added: forge#1827 -->
**NEVER use plan mode (EnterPlanMode).**

<!-- FORGE:SPEC_LOADED — work-on/review.md loaded and active. Agent is bound by this spec. -->

---

## Inputs

Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
- `{NUMBER}` — issue number (required)
- `--repo {GH_REPO}` — GitHub repo (e.g. `{owner}/{repo}` — resolved from `forge.yaml → project`)
- `--gh-flag {GH_FLAG}` — gh CLI repo flag (e.g. `-R {owner}/{repo}`)
- `--worktree {WORKTREE_PATH}` — absolute path to the git worktree
- `--branch {BRANCH}` — feature branch name (e.g. `feat/my-feature`)
- `--base {PR_BASE}` — PR target branch (e.g. `milestone/modular-pipeline-architecture` or `staging`)

---

## Phase R0: Load State from GitHub (MANDATORY)

Re-read current state before doing anything:

```bash
gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json number,title,body,labels,state,milestone

# Get builder comment (for branch + commit info)
gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/{NUMBER}/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("FORGE:BUILDER")) | .body'

# Check if PR already exists for this branch
gh pr list {GH_FLAG} --head {BRANCH} --json number,state,url 2>/dev/null
```

**Resume check**:
- If PR already exists AND is OPEN → run the **HEAD-unchanged re-review guard** below before proceeding to Phase R3
- If PR already exists AND is MERGED → return `REVIEW_RESULT: status: ALREADY_MERGED`
- If no `<!-- FORGE:BUILDER -->` comment exists → EXIT with `REVIEW_RESULT: status: BLOCKED`, blocker: "FORGE:BUILDER comment not found — implement phase may not have completed"

**HEAD-unchanged re-review guard** (MANDATORY when a PR already exists and is OPEN) <!-- Added: forge#2243 --> — a PR whose most recent review verdict was CHANGES REQUESTED must not be resubmitted for a full domain-agent review fan-out if nothing has changed since that verdict. `/review-pr` records the exact commit it reviewed in its verdict comment (`CHANGES REQUESTED: commit {sha} — ...`, see `commands/review-pr.md` Phase 8/9); compare that recorded sha against the PR's current `headRefOid`:

```bash
# NOTE: the CHANGES REQUESTED verdict is posted via `gh pr review --comment` (see
# commands/review-pr.md Phase 7B) — that creates a PullRequestReview, which surfaces under
# the `reviews` field, NOT `comments` (issue/PR comments are a separate GraphQL object).
# Query both --json reviews and --json comments (same combined-read pattern already used in
# work-on.md's REVIEW_BODIES/REVIEW_PRESENT checks) so this guard works regardless of which
# GitHub object type carries the verdict text.
LAST_VERDICT=$(gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json reviews,comments \
  --jq '([.reviews[] | {body, created_at: (.submittedAt // "")}] + [.comments[] | {body, created_at: (.createdAt // "")}]) | map(select(.body | test("CHANGES REQUESTED: commit "))) | sort_by(.created_at) | last | .body // ""' 2>/dev/null)
LAST_VERDICT_SHA=$(echo "$LAST_VERDICT" | grep -oE 'CHANGES REQUESTED: commit [0-9a-f]+' | grep -oE '[0-9a-f]+$' | head -1)
CURRENT_SHA_SHORT=$(gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid' 2>/dev/null | cut -c1-7)

if [ -n "$LAST_VERDICT_SHA" ] && [ "$LAST_VERDICT_SHA" = "$CURRENT_SHA_SHORT" ]; then
  echo "HEAD unchanged since last CHANGES REQUESTED verdict ($LAST_VERDICT_SHA) — skipping re-review."
  # No DRY_RUN/governor guard here — consistent with every other gh issue comment/edit call
  # already in this file (e.g. the Push Failed / Push Blocked sections below), none of which
  # are gated either. This is a report-and-stop action (blocks re-review, does not merge or
  # delete anything), same risk class as those pre-existing calls.
  REREVIEW_SKIP_BODY=$(cat <<SKIP_EOF
## Re-Review Skipped — HEAD Unchanged

PR #{PR_NUMBER}'s HEAD (${CURRENT_SHA_SHORT}) has not changed since the last CHANGES REQUESTED verdict. Re-running /review-pr would re-review byte-identical code and reproduce the same verdict — this is a pure waste of a full domain-agent fan-out.

The PR is already needs-human (or will be shortly, if this is the first time this guard has fired for it). Progress here now depends on remediation (fix the findings, push a new commit, re-review) rather than another raw review submission. If running under /orchestrate, item 6.4 in phase-4-execution.md auto-dispatches remediation for any needs-human-gated issue, including this one (see forge#2243) — no manual action should be needed. If running standalone, invoke /work-on {PR_NUMBER} --remediate --issue {NUMBER} directly.

<!-- FORGE:REREVIEW_SKIPPED -->
SKIP_EOF
)
  gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "$REREVIEW_SKIP_BODY" # <!-- allowlist:check-command-side-effects -->
  gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label needs-human 2>/dev/null || true # <!-- allowlist:check-command-side-effects -->
  # Return REVIEW_RESULT: status: BLOCKED — do not invoke /review-pr again on unchanged HEAD
  exit 1
fi
```

If `LAST_VERDICT_SHA` is empty (no prior CHANGES REQUESTED verdict found) or differs from the current HEAD (a new commit was pushed since the last verdict — e.g. by remediation), proceed normally to Phase R3.

---

## Phase R1: Pre-Push Ancestry Guard

Before pushing, verify the branch contains no merge commits from branches outside the PR base ancestry. This is the final defense against milestone-code-onto-staging contamination.

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
# Skip if PR_BASE does not exist on origin yet (new branch — no contamination possible)
if git ls-remote --exit-code origin {PR_BASE} >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  MERGE_COMMITS=$(git log --merges {BRANCH} ^origin/{PR_BASE} 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$MERGE_COMMITS" ]; then
    echo "PRE-PUSH ANCESTRY GUARD FAILED: merge commits from outside {PR_BASE} detected"
    gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "## Pre-Push Ancestry Guard Failed

Branch \`{BRANCH}\` contains merge commits from branches outside the PR base (\`{PR_BASE}\`). Pushing this branch risks contaminating \`{PR_BASE}\` with unapproved code (e.g. milestone code leaking onto staging).

**Detected merge commits**:
\`\`\`
${MERGE_COMMITS}
\`\`\`

Do NOT push this branch. Human review required to identify the source of the merge commits and clean the branch history (e.g. via \`git rebase\` to replay only the intended commits onto \`origin/{PR_BASE}\`).

<!-- FORGE:PUSH_BLOCKED -->"
    gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label "needs-human"
    # Return REVIEW_RESULT: status: BLOCKED — do not push
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

## Phase R1: Non-Empty Commit Guard (MANDATORY — run before push) <!-- Added: forge#1305 -->

Before pushing, verify the branch has at least one commit ahead of the PR base. This is the last-line defense against the phantom-commit hazard: a session that resumed from a partial FORGE:BUILDER comment (without `:COMPLETE`) would have skipped the commit step and could otherwise push an empty branch.

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
# Count commits on this branch that are not reachable from origin/{PR_BASE}
COMMIT_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count HEAD ^origin/{PR_BASE} 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
if [ "$COMMIT_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
  gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "## Push Blocked — No Commits Ahead of Base

Branch \`{BRANCH}\` has 0 commits ahead of \`origin/{PR_BASE}\`. Pushing this branch would create an empty PR.

**Likely cause**: Build was interrupted after the FORGE:BUILDER comment was posted (implement.md Phase I6) but before the commit was created (validate.md Phase V5). The branch was pushed with no implementation on it.

**Resolution**: Delete this branch, re-run \`/work-on {NUMBER}\` to restart the build phase. The partial FORGE:BUILDER comment (lacking \`FORGE:BUILDER:COMPLETE\`) will be detected and deleted, and the build will restart cleanly.

<!-- FORGE:PUSH_BLOCKED_EMPTY_BRANCH -->"
  gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label "needs-human"
  exit 1
fi
echo "Commit count ahead of origin/{PR_BASE}: $COMMIT_COUNT — OK to push"
```

## Phase R1: Push Branch

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
git push origin {BRANCH}
```

If push fails, retry with `--force-with-lease`:
```bash
git push origin {BRANCH} --force-with-lease
```

If still fails:
```bash
gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "## Push Failed

Branch \`{BRANCH}\` could not be pushed to origin.

**Error**: {ERROR_OUTPUT}

This may indicate a merge conflict or remote rejection. Human review required.

<!-- FORGE:PUSH_FAILED -->"

gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label "needs-human"
```
Return `REVIEW_RESULT: status: BLOCKED`, blocker: "git push failed".

---

## Phase R2: Create PR

### R2A: Determine PR title

Derive from issue title:
- `fix(...):`  → `Fix: {description}`
- `feat(...):`  → `Feat: {description}`
- `refactor(...):`  → `Refactor: {description}`
- `docs(...):`  → `Docs: {description}`
- fallback: use issue title as-is

### R2B: Resolve attribution footer (optional)

Before creating the PR, check `forge.yaml → attribution.pr_footer`:

```bash
ATTRIBUTION_PR_FOOTER=$(grep -A5 "^attribution:" forge.yaml 2>/dev/null | grep "pr_footer:" | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"' || echo "false")
```

If `ATTRIBUTION_PR_FOOTER` is `true`, append the following footer to the PR body (once — never duplicate on retries):

```
> ⚒️ Orchestrated with [ForgeDock](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock) — state, scheduling, review, and memory on GitHub.
```

### R2C: Create PR

For a batch issue, construct a non-closing reference line from `BATCH_MEMBERS` before creating the PR:

```bash
BATCH_MEMBER_REFS=""
if [ "${IS_BATCH:-0}" = "1" ]; then
  BATCH_MEMBER_REFS=$(printf 'Refs #%s\n' "${BATCH_MEMBERS[@]}")
fi
```

```bash
gh pr create {GH_FLAG} \
  --base {PR_BASE} \
  --head {BRANCH} \
  --title "{PR_TITLE}" \
  --body "## Summary

{BRIEF_DESCRIPTION_FROM_ISSUE_BODY}

## Changes

{BULLETED_LIST_OF_KEY_CHANGES_FROM_BUILDER_COMMENT}

## Testing

{TESTING_CHECKLIST_FROM_BUILDER_COMMENT}

---

Closes #{NUMBER}
${BATCH_MEMBER_REFS}
**Batch member disposition**: The batch issue is the code unit being closed. Referenced members that require human or operator action remain open as a split outcome.

**Implementation branch**: \`{BRANCH}\`
**Base**: \`{PR_BASE}\`
{IF_ATTRIBUTION_PR_FOOTER_TRUE:
> ⚒️ Orchestrated with [ForgeDock](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock) — state, scheduling, review, and memory on GitHub.}"
```

**Note**: `Closes #{NUMBER}` documents intent but does NOT auto-close for non-default-branch PRs. The close subcommand handles explicit closure after merge.

**Attribution guard**: The footer line is appended once at PR creation. If the PR already exists (resume path), do NOT append the footer again — check the existing PR body first.

**No assistant attribution**: The PR body is exactly the sections above (plus the optional ForgeDock footer). Do NOT add a `🤖 Generated with Claude Code` line, a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, or any assistant-tool attribution — the pipeline is ForgeDock-branded. A PreToolUse guard hard-blocks it as a backstop (`bin/hooks/pre-tool-use.mjs` Rule 5).

If PR creation fails because a PR already exists for this branch:
```bash
gh pr list {GH_FLAG} --head {BRANCH} --json number,url --jq '.[0]'
```
Use the existing PR number and continue.

### R2D: Update labels

```bash
gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} \
  --add-label "workflow:in-review" \
  --remove-label "workflow:building"
```

---

## Phase R3: Invoke /review-pr with --auto-merge

Re-read the PR number (from creation or from resume check):

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list {GH_FLAG} --head {BRANCH} --json number --jq '.[0].number')
```

Post a progress comment before delegating:

```bash
gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "## Submitting for Review

PR #${PR_NUMBER} created targeting \`{PR_BASE}\`. Invoking /review-pr with --auto-merge.

Review will: analyze changes → spawn domain agents → post findings → merge → close issue → clean up worktree.

<!-- FORGE:REVIEW_STARTED -->"
```

Invoke the review command:

```
Skill(skill="review-pr", args="{PR_NUMBER} --auto-merge --issue {NUMBER} --base {PR_BASE} --gh-flag {GH_FLAG}")
```

**OpenCode joined-child contract**: When `FORGE_RUNTIME=opencode` (or an OpenCode runtime marker is present), invoke this load-bearing review through one native foreground `task` instead of treating the `Skill(...)` line as an asynchronous handoff:

```
if DRY_RUN=true:
  record "Would invoke the foreground review task for PR #{PR_NUMBER}."
else:
  task(
    description="Review PR #{PR_NUMBER}",
    subagent_type="general",
    background=false,
    prompt="Load commands/review-pr.md and execute it for PR {PR_NUMBER} with --auto-merge --issue {NUMBER} --base {PR_BASE} --gh-flag {GH_FLAG}. Return only the structured REVIEW_RESULT block after the review reaches its outcome."
  )
```

Wait for that task's completed result before Phase R4. Propagate its `REVIEW_RESULT` as this module's child state; do not return `REVIEW_RESULT`, report progress, release an orchestrator slot, or begin close work while the child is running. If the child errors or returns no parseable `REVIEW_RESULT`, return `REVIEW_RESULT: status: BLOCKED` with the child failure as the blocker. The normal `Skill(...)` invocation above remains the non-OpenCode path.

/review-pr handles: full domain-agent review → post findings as separate issues (non-blocking) → merge the PR → close the issue → clean up worktree.

---

## Phase R4: Verify Review Outcome

After /review-pr returns, verify the outcome:

```bash
# Check PR state
gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json state,mergedAt --jq '{state: .state, mergedAt: .mergedAt}'

# Check issue state
gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json state --jq '.state'
```

**Cases**:
- PR MERGED (issue OPEN or CLOSED) → write checkpoint, then return `REVIEW_RESULT: status: COMPLETE` — do NOT close the issue or add labels here; the router will route to `work-on:close` which handles issue closure, label updates, project board, trajectory log, and worktree cleanup.

  Write machine-readable phase checkpoint before returning (MANDATORY when PR is MERGED):
  ```bash
  CHECKPOINT_TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
  gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "<!-- FORGE:CHECKPOINT -->
  \`\`\`json
  {\"phase\": \"REVIEW\", \"status\": \"COMPLETE\", \"next_phase\": \"CLOSE\", \"timestamp\": \"${CHECKPOINT_TIMESTAMP}\"}
  \`\`\`"
  ```

- PR NOT MERGED → attempt manual merge:
  ```bash
  gh pr merge {PR_NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --merge --auto
  ```
  If merge fails: post comment, add `needs-human`, return `REVIEW_RESULT: status: BLOCKED`

---

## Controlled refresh before review

Before pushing, creating a PR, or invoking `/review-pr`, re-fetch the authoritative
`refs/heads/staging` and compare its exact SHA with the immutable launch/current base.
When a verified sibling merge advanced the target, publish `FORGE:BASE_REFRESH` with the
launch SHA, old/new target SHAs, target ref, sibling merge SHA, merge-base SHA, and
attempt. Prove the movement is authorized and reachable; unexpected or ambiguous
movement is GATED.

Preserve the owned branch, issue commits, and existing PR. Before a PR exists, use a
guarded synchronization onto the verified target. After a PR exists, integrate the
verified target non-destructively and push only with the expected remote-head lease;
never reset, overwrite, or force-push an unverified remote head. Conflicts and lease
mismatch remain automated GATED outcomes.

After refresh, rerun all affected verification and acceptance checks, update the same
PR, and freeze the refreshed exact base/head/merge-base identity. Invoke review only
with that identity; all earlier reviewer receipts and approvals are stale and cannot
authorize merge. The refreshed review must use a fresh complete panel. See
`specs/qualitative-review-protocol.md`.

## Output

**After posting this result, immediately proceed to the close subcommand — do NOT stop here. `REVIEW_RESULT: status: COMPLETE` is an intermediate result, NOT a terminal state. The pipeline is not done. You MUST invoke `Skill("work-on:close", ...)` now to close the issue, update labels to `workflow:merged`, post the trajectory log, and clean up the worktree.**

Output this structured block:

```
REVIEW_RESULT:
  status: COMPLETE | ALREADY_MERGED | BLOCKED
  pr_number: {PR_NUMBER}
  pr_url: {PR_URL}
  merged_to: {PR_BASE}
  blocker: {description if status=BLOCKED}
```

---

## Integration Point in work-on.md

This module runs at **Phases 4–5** — after validate returns `GATE_PASSED: true`, before close:

```
3F.5 → Validate (by build/validate.md) — gate passed
4    → [THIS MODULE] Push + PR creation + /review-pr invocation + merge verification
5    → Close (by close.md) — trajectory, parent tracker, summary
```

/review-pr is invoked within this module (not by the router). The router waits for REVIEW_RESULT before invoking close.md.

### Integration-lane review binding

When the issue is a member of a typed work-order lane, the review base and branch must come from the durable lane binding. Findings inherit the lane ID, branch, and frozen origin; remediation updates the same lane PR. A lane-integrated member is not eligible for issue closure until the lane's separate promotion PR has passed exact-head bundle review and mergeability gates.
