# /work-on:investigate — Issue Investigation Subcommand

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

Standalone investigation phase for the work-on pipeline. Validates whether an issue is real, determines root cause, posts a structured FORGE:INVESTIGATOR comment to GitHub, and updates workflow labels.

**Agent model policy**: `model: "{DEFAULT_MODEL}"` — resolved from forge.yaml `agents.default_model`, else "sonnet" (standard tier). Fallback: `model: "opus"` if rate-limited. Feature gate: pass `effort` in Task/Skill spawns only on Claude Code >= 2.1.154. This file's mechanical bits (1A label set, `FORGE:CHECKPOINT` writes) stay at this tier because they're interleaved with the reasoning-heavy investigation steps in the same `Skill()` invocation — see `work-on.md` section "Model and Effort Tiering — What Actually Applies". <!-- Added: forge#1827 -->
**NEVER use plan mode (EnterPlanMode).**

<!-- FORGE:SPEC_LOADED — work-on/investigate.md loaded and active. Agent is bound by this spec. -->

---

## Inputs

Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
- `{NUMBER}` — issue number (required)
- `--repo {GH_REPO}` — GitHub repo (e.g. `{owner}/{repo}` — resolved from `forge.yaml → project`)
- `--gh-flag {GH_FLAG}` — gh CLI repo flag (e.g. `-R {owner}/{repo}`)

If called from `work-on`, these are passed through. If invoked standalone, `--repo` and `--gh-flag` are resolved from `forge.yaml → project`.

---

## Phase 0.5: Memory Retrieval — Prior Run Priors <!-- Added: forge#1316 -->

**Goal**: Before investigating, retrieve the top-k relevant prior pipeline runs from the per-repo memory index. Inject confirmed priors into the investigation context so the pipeline compounds intelligence across runs.

**This phase is non-blocking** — if the memory index is absent or retrieval fails, log the reason and proceed to Phase 1A. Never stall the pipeline for memory.

**Note on Gist visibility (forge#1587)**: The memory-index Gist is created **secret** (see `close.md` Phase C5.2 — no `--public` flag). `gh gist list` and `gh gist view` operate against the authenticated user's own Gists by description/id regardless of public/secret status, so the retrieval steps below work unchanged against a secret Gist. No code change is needed here — this note exists only so a future edit doesn't reintroduce a "must be public to be readable" assumption.

### Step 1: Locate memory index Gist

The memory index is a GitHub Gist tagged `<!-- FORGE:MEMORY_INDEX: {GH_REPO} -->`. Find it:

```bash
MEMORY_INDEX_URL=$(gh gist list --limit 100 \
  --jq '.[] | select(.description | contains("FORGE:MEMORY_INDEX: {GH_REPO}")) | .url' 2>/dev/null | head -1)

MEMORY_INDEX_ID=$(gh gist list --limit 100 \
  --jq '.[] | select(.description | contains("FORGE:MEMORY_INDEX: {GH_REPO}")) | .id' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

If no memory index found: log `[MEMORY] No memory index for {GH_REPO} — starting fresh` and skip to Phase 1A.

### Step 2: Retrieve relevant priors (top-k similarity)

Read the memory index content:

```bash
MEMORY_CONTENT=$(gh gist view "$MEMORY_INDEX_ID" 2>/dev/null)
```

The memory index is a newline-delimited list of prior run entries, each formatted as:

```
MEMORY_ENTRY: issue={N} title="{TITLE}" domain="{DOMAIN_TAGS}" root_cause="{ROOT_CAUSE_SUMMARY}" outcome="{merged|invalid|blocked}" files="{AFFECTED_FILES}" lesson="{KEY_LESSON_ONE_LINE}" timestamp={ISO}
```

**Retrieve top-3 relevant priors** by matching against the current issue title and body:

1. Extract keywords from the current issue title: lowercase, remove stop words, keep noun/verb tokens
2. Score each memory entry: +2 for a file path overlap, +1 per keyword match in title/root_cause/lesson
3. Return the top-3 highest-scoring entries (minimum score ≥ 1 to filter noise)

If no entries score ≥ 1: log `[MEMORY] No relevant priors found` and skip to Phase 1A.

### Step 3: Inject priors into investigation context

For each retrieved prior, emit a structured block that Phase 1B can reference:

```
[MEMORY PRIOR #{RANK}]
Issue: #{issue} — {title}
Root cause: {root_cause}
Outcome: {outcome}
Key lesson: {lesson}
Affected files: {files}
```

Print these blocks to stdout before Phase 1A begins. During Phase 1B (step 3 — blame analysis and step 5 — pickaxe pass), **explicitly check whether the current issue's suspected symbol or file appears in any prior root cause or affected files**. If a match is found, cite it in the FORGE:INVESTIGATOR comment's History Findings field as a `[MEMORY PRIOR]` hit.

---

## Phase 0.6: Forge Ledger Pre-Recall <!-- Added: forge#1740 -->

**Goal**: Query the Forge Ledger knowledge index for prior cards matching this issue's title terms, affected files, and symbols — **before reading any code**. Inject above-threshold results with explicit delta-verification framing so the investigator builds on prior knowledge rather than re-deriving it.

**This phase is non-blocking** — if the index is absent, empty, or returns no match above threshold, log a single line and proceed to Phase 1A. Never stall the pipeline for recall.

**Relationship to Phase 0.5**: Phase 0.5 retrieves structured priors from the Gist-based FORGE:MEMORY_INDEX (coarse keyword scoring over MEMORY_ENTRY lines). Phase 0.6 queries the Forge Ledger index (BM25 over structured knowledge cards, indexed by `build-knowledge-index.mjs`). Both are complementary and both run — neither replaces the other.

### Step 1: Probe for index

```bash
RECALL_PATH="${REPO_PATH:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)}/bin/recall.mjs"
LEDGER_AVAILABLE=0

if [ -f "$RECALL_PATH" ]; then
  # Quick probe: does the index exist and have at least one card?
  PROBE=$(node "$RECALL_PATH" --doctor 2>/dev/null | grep "^Total cards:" | grep -v "^Total cards:    0" || true)
  [ -n "$PROBE" ] && LEDGER_AVAILABLE=1
fi

if [ "$LEDGER_AVAILABLE" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "[recall] Forge Ledger index absent or empty — skipping Phase 0.6, proceeding to Phase 1A"
  # → Continue to Phase 1A
fi
```

### Step 2: Build combined query (title terms + symbols + affected files)

Extract query components from the issue body and title. The recall CLI accepts free text (BM25 ranked) plus repeated `--file` flags (exact-match boost):

```bash
# Extract title keywords: lowercase, remove stop words, keep noun/verb tokens (≥4 chars)
ISSUE_TITLE=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json title --jq '.title' 2>/dev/null || echo '')
TITLE_TERMS=$(echo "$ISSUE_TITLE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
  | sed 's/[^a-z0-9 ]/ /g' \
  | tr ' ' '\n' \
  | grep -E '^[a-z]{4,}$' \
  | grep -vE '^(with|that|this|from|into|have|will|when|then|than|them|they|been|were|also|only|does|some|each|more|over|such|both|most|other|many|after|about|should|would|could|their|these|those|which|where|there|being|while|using|since|until|before|under|above)$' \
  | sort -u | head -10 | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs)

# Extract affected files from the issue body's ## Affected Files section
ISSUE_BODY=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json body --jq '.body' 2>/dev/null || echo '')
AFFECTED_FILES_RAW=$(echo "$ISSUE_BODY" \
  | sed -n '/^## Affected Files/,/^## /p' \
  | grep -oE '`[^`]+\.(md|mjs|js|ts|py|sh|yaml|yml|json)`' \
  | tr -d '`' | sort -u | head -5)

# Extract symbols: backtick-quoted identifiers from the issue body (≥4 chars, camelCase or snake_case)
SYMBOLS_RAW=$(echo "$ISSUE_BODY" \
  | grep -oE '`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]{3,}`' \
  | tr -d '`' | sort -u | head -5)

# Build --file flags (one per affected file)
FILE_FLAGS=""
while IFS= read -r f; do
  [ -n "$f" ] && FILE_FLAGS="$FILE_FLAGS --file $f"
done <<< "$AFFECTED_FILES_RAW"

# Build --symbol flag (first symbol only — recall supports one --symbol)
SYMBOL_FLAG=""
FIRST_SYMBOL=$(echo "$SYMBOLS_RAW" | head -1)
[ -n "$FIRST_SYMBOL" ] && SYMBOL_FLAG="--symbol $FIRST_SYMBOL"
```

### Step 3: Run recall query and capture results

```bash
RECALL_RESULTS=""
RECALL_ISSUE_CITATIONS=""

if [ "$LEDGER_AVAILABLE" -eq 1 ] && [ -n "$TITLE_TERMS$FILE_FLAGS$SYMBOL_FLAG" ]; then
  echo "[recall] Querying Forge Ledger: terms='${TITLE_TERMS}' files='${AFFECTED_FILES_RAW}' symbol='${FIRST_SYMBOL}'"

  # Run combined query: title terms (free text) + file flags + symbol + min-score threshold
  # --json for machine-readable output; --min-score 0.3 filters weak matches (noise gate)
  RECALL_JSON=$(node "$RECALL_PATH" \
    $TITLE_TERMS \
    $FILE_FLAGS \
    $SYMBOL_FLAG \
    --k 5 \
    --min-score 0.3 \
    --json \
    2>/dev/null || echo '[]')

  # Count results
  RECALL_COUNT=$(echo "$RECALL_JSON" | node -e "
    let d = ''; process.stdin.on('data', c => d += c);
    process.stdin.on('end', () => {
      try { console.log(JSON.parse(d).length); } catch { console.log(0); }
    });
  " 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

  if [ "${RECALL_COUNT:-0}" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "[recall] Found ${RECALL_COUNT} prior card(s) above threshold — injecting with delta-verification framing"

    # Extract issue citations for the Prior Investigations field in the FORGE:INVESTIGATOR comment
    RECALL_ISSUE_CITATIONS=$(echo "$RECALL_JSON" | node -e "
      let d = ''; process.stdin.on('data', c => d += c);
      process.stdin.on('end', () => {
        try {
          const cards = JSON.parse(d);
          const seen = new Set();
          const cites = cards
            .filter(c => { if (seen.has(c.issue)) return false; seen.add(c.issue); return true; })
            .map(c => '#' + c.issue)
            .join(', ');
          console.log(cites);
        } catch { console.log(''); }
      });
    " 2>/dev/null || echo '')

    # Format cards as human-readable text for injection (not raw JSON)
    RECALL_FORMATTED=$(echo "$RECALL_JSON" | node -e "
      let d = ''; process.stdin.on('data', c => d += c);
      process.stdin.on('end', () => {
        try {
          const cards = JSON.parse(d);
          const lines = [];
          for (const c of cards) {
            lines.push('── ' + c.kind.toUpperCase() + ' from #' + c.issue + ' (score: ' + c.score.toFixed(2) + ') ──');
            if (c.rootCause)  lines.push('Root Cause: ' + c.rootCause);
            if (c.prevention) lines.push('Fix/Prevention: ' + c.prevention);
            if (c.pattern)    lines.push('Pattern: ' + c.pattern);
            if (c.verdict)    lines.push('Verdict: ' + c.verdict + ' (' + (c.confidence || '?') + ')');
            if (c.paths && c.paths.length) lines.push('Files: ' + c.paths.slice(0,3).join(', '));
          }
          console.log(lines.join('\n'));
        } catch (e) { console.log(''); }
      });
    " 2>/dev/null || echo '')

    # Cap at ≤ 2K chars (same budget as context C0 Gist summaries)
    RECALL_RESULTS=$(echo "$RECALL_FORMATTED" | head -c 2048)
  else
    echo "[recall] No prior cards above threshold (min-score 0.3) — investigating from scratch"
  fi
fi
```

### Step 4: Inject recall results into investigation context

If `RECALL_RESULTS` is non-empty, print the following block to stdout **before Phase 1A begins**. The investigation steps in Phase 1B MUST treat this as starting context — verify deltas against current code rather than re-deriving the prior model.

**If `RECALL_RESULTS` is empty**: skip this step entirely and proceed to Phase 1A.

```
[FORGE:RECALL_PRIOR — Forge Ledger pre-recall results]
Prior cards matched this issue above threshold (min-score 0.3).

CRITICAL FRAMING: These cards describe prior findings on the same files/symbols.
  → Verify the deltas against current code — do NOT re-derive the prior model.
  → Stale cards (status: stale) are excluded by default — the query runs without
     --include-stale. Do not treat any card as authoritative without confirming
     the finding still exists in the current code.
  → Cite confirmed priors in the FORGE:INVESTIGATOR "Prior Investigations" field.

${RECALL_RESULTS}

[END FORGE:RECALL_PRIOR]
```

Store `RECALL_ISSUE_CITATIONS` in a variable — it is used in Phase 1C to populate the `**Prior Investigations (via recall)**` field in the FORGE:INVESTIGATOR comment.

---

## Phase 1A: Load Issue & Check Resume State

```bash
gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json number,title,body,labels,state,comments
gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/{NUMBER}/comments --jq '.[] | {id: .id, body: .body}'
```

**Resume logic**:
- A comment ending `<!-- INVESTIGATION:INVALID -->` remains terminal and may be reused; no build follows it.
- Reuse a `<!-- INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE -->` comment only when the same comment contains the current `### Same-Behavior Check` section with `Behavior followed`, `Other relevant paths checked`, and `Scope result`. A legacy completion marker without this section does not authorize build. Preserve legacy/incomplete artifacts as history and post a superseding investigation.
- If `<!-- FORGE:INVESTIGATOR -->` exists with neither terminal sentinel, investigation was interrupted; delete only that partial comment and restart:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/comments/{COMMENT_ID} -X DELETE
  ```
- If no investigator comment → proceed with fresh investigation

**Set label**:
```bash
gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label "workflow:investigating"
gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --remove-label "workflow:ready-to-build,workflow:building,workflow:in-review" 2>/dev/null || true
```

---

## Phase 1B: Investigate

**Mission**: Validate whether the issue is real. Assume description is wrong until proven otherwise.

### Resolve target repo and branch

The target repo is `{GH_REPO}` (resolved from `forge.yaml → project`). The working directory is `{REPO_PATH}` (resolved from `forge.yaml → paths.root`).

**Domain-to-files mapping**: The repo's domain structure depends on the project. Before investigating, read the issue body and labels to identify the affected domain. Then look at the repo's directory structure under `{REPO_PATH}` to locate relevant files. Common entry points:
- Command/prompt files: `commands/`, `.claude/commands/`
- Backend services: any `services/`, `routers/`, `core/` directories
- Frontend: any `web/`, `frontend/`, `src/` directories
- Infrastructure: `.github/workflows/`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `infra/`
- Config: `forge.yaml`, `.env.example`, any `config/` directory

If the issue specifies a **Code branch** (`**Code branch**: \`{branch}\``), check out that branch — the affected files may not be on the default branch.

### Code Index Query (run BEFORE any grep exploration)

If `scripts/code-index.sh` exists under `{REPO_PATH}`, query the pre-built symbol/import index first. This yields deterministic answers in one tool call and avoids redundant grep exploration across agents.

```bash
# Step 0A: Ensure index is current (cache-hit on unchanged HEAD — zero cost if already built)
bash {REPO_PATH}/scripts/code-index.sh --repo-path {REPO_PATH} 2>/dev/null || true

# Step 0B: Look up the symbol or file named in the issue (replace {SYMBOL} with the relevant name)
bash {REPO_PATH}/scripts/code-index.sh query --symbol {SYMBOL} --repo-path {REPO_PATH} 2>/dev/null || true

# Step 0C: Find all callers of that symbol
bash {REPO_PATH}/scripts/code-index.sh query --callers {SYMBOL} --repo-path {REPO_PATH} 2>/dev/null || true

# Step 0D: Find all importers of an affected file
bash {REPO_PATH}/scripts/code-index.sh query --importers {AFFECTED_FILE} --repo-path {REPO_PATH} 2>/dev/null || true

# Step 0E: Get all files in the affected domain (from issue labels/body)
bash {REPO_PATH}/scripts/code-index.sh query --domain {DOMAIN_LABEL} --repo-path {REPO_PATH} 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Fallback**: If `scripts/code-index.sh` is absent or returns no results, proceed with standard grep exploration below. The index is an acceleration layer — its absence never blocks investigation.

### Investigation steps

1. **Check the right branch** — read from the branch specified in the issue body (`**Code branch**: \`{branch}\``) if present
2. **Read domain files** — start with the key files for the affected domain (use index query results from Step 0E as the file list; fall back to directory inspection if index is absent)
3. **Verify claims** — does the code actually have the problem described?
4. **Git blame** — trace when/why the relevant code was written. Run bounded, local commands (no network round-trip):
   ```bash
   # Introducing commit for each affected file (first commit that added it)
   git log --reverse --format='%h %an %ad %s' --date=short -- {affected_file} | head -1
   # Last-touch commit (most recent change)
   git log -1 --format='%h %an %ad %s' --date=short -- {affected_file}
   # Line-level blame for a specific suspect hunk, if the issue names one
   git blame -L {start},{end} -- {affected_file}
   ```
   Record the introducing commit and last-touch commit for each primary affected file — this feeds the mandatory **History findings** field in Phase 1C.
5. **Domain context discovery** (narrow scope only, 1–5 files):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --all -30 -- {affected_files} | grep -oP '#\d+' | sort -u
   gh issue list -R {GH_REPO} --state closed --limit 8 --search "{function_name}"
   ```
   Keep only file/function-level overlap. Max 5 related issues. Everything is a hint to verify, not a fact.

   **Pickaxe pass (prior fix / regression detection)** — bounded to one pass, capped at 5 hits: search for prior additions/removals of the suspected symbol or literal string named in the issue (a function name, error string, or config key), independent of whether that fix was ever linked to a filed issue:
   ```bash
   git log -S"{suspected_symbol_or_string}" --oneline -- {affected_files} | head -5
   # Use -G instead of -S when the target is a regex pattern rather than a literal string
   git log -G"{pattern}" --oneline -- {affected_files} | head -5
   ```
   Any hit here is a candidate prior fix or reintroduced defect — read the commit body (`git show {hash}`) to confirm before citing it. Feed confirmed hits into the History findings field and let them inform the verdict (e.g. a defect being reintroduced raises severity).
6. **Determine root cause** — what's actually broken or missing?
7. **Same-Behavior Check** — before finalizing affected files, follow the specific broken value, state, or decision from where it enters the system to where it produces its final effect. Search the actual repository for other relevant callers, readers, writers, serializers, shortcuts, or sibling paths that handle the same behavior. Include any path that must change for the fix to be complete, or record source evidence that it is already safe. Do not inspect unrelated code; stop when the production-reachable paths for this specific behavior are accounted for.
8. **Identify affected files** — full list of files that need changes, including any added by the Same-Behavior Check
9. **Fix-approach validation** — if the issue proposes a fix, don't adopt it as spec. Trace through the target system's middleware, auth, routing, config. Cross-domain: if fix in domain A interacts with domain B, read domain B's files too.

---

## Phase 1C: Post Investigation Comment

The comment MUST include a terminal sentinel at the very end, AFTER all required sections are present. **The sentinel is conditional on the resolved Verdict — it is NOT always `<!-- INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE -->`:**

- **Verdict is INVALID** → close with `<!-- INVESTIGATION:INVALID -->`. This is a distinct, already-wired-up terminal marker: `bin/engine/phases.mjs`'s `detectOutcome` for the `investigate` phase checks for it explicitly (ahead of `INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE`) and routes to `terminalReason: "invalid"`; `bin/hooks/interactive-engine.mjs`'s `PHASE_MARKERS` table also already treats it as terminal. Emitting `INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE` for an INVALID verdict is what previously caused every completed investigation to read as `{verdict: "CONFIRMED"}` regardless of actual outcome — do NOT regress this (forge#2350).
- **Verdict is CONFIRMED or PARTIAL** → close with `<!-- INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE -->` as before (PARTIAL still routes to `ready-to-build` in Phase 1D — only INVALID gets the distinct terminal sentinel).

Compute the sentinel once, before building the comment body:

```bash
if [ "{VERDICT}" = "INVALID" ]; then
  INVESTIGATION_SENTINEL="<!-- INVESTIGATION:INVALID -->"
else
  INVESTIGATION_SENTINEL="<!-- INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE -->"
fi
```

**CODEC PATH (forge#1727)**: Construct the annotation body via the protocol codec — do NOT hand-roll the `<!-- FORGE:INVESTIGATOR -->` header. Use `forge-annotation.sh write INVESTIGATOR --field ...` or `node packages/protocol/src/cli.js emit INVESTIGATOR --field ...` to produce the opening tag and completion sentinel. Fill in the Markdown body sections below. The full pattern:

**Caveat (forge#2368)**: `packages/protocol/src/types.js`'s `INVESTIGATOR.completionSentinel` is a single fixed value (`'INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE'`) and `packages/protocol/src/emit.js` appends it unconditionally — the codec does NOT currently support the verdict-conditional sentinel selection described above, and cannot emit `INVESTIGATION:INVALID`. Using the CODEC PATH for an INVALID-verdict investigation would silently regress the forge#2350 fix (every investigation would again read as `{verdict: "CONFIRMED"}`). Until the codec is extended to support a verdict-conditional sentinel, the hand-rolled block above/below (using the `${INVESTIGATION_SENTINEL}` variable computed above) is the authoritative path for Phase 1C — do not use the CODEC PATH for this annotation.

```bash
# Build the annotation body via codec (escaping and sentinel handled by codec)
ANNOTATION_BODY=$(node packages/protocol/src/cli.js emit INVESTIGATOR \
  --field "Verdict={VERDICT}" \
  --field "Confidence={CONFIDENCE}" \
  --field "Severity={SEVERITY}" \
  --field "Task Type={TASK_TYPE}" \
  --field "Decomposition Assessment={YES|NO} — {reason}")
# ANNOTATION_BODY now has opening tag + required fields + INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE sentinel.
# NOTE: the codec's sentinel is fixed — do not use this path when Verdict=INVALID (see caveat above).
# Append the Markdown body sections to it before posting.
```

Before posting, resolve the attribution annotation link from `forge.yaml`:

```bash
ATTRIBUTION_ANNOTATION_LINK=$(grep -A5 "^attribution:" forge.yaml 2>/dev/null | grep "annotation_link:" | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"' || echo "false")
ANNOTATION_LINK_FOOTER=""
if [ "$ATTRIBUTION_ANNOTATION_LINK" = "true" ]; then
  ANNOTATION_LINK_FOOTER="

**Verdict**: {CONFIRMED|PARTIAL|INVALID}
**Confidence**: {HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}
**Severity**: {CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}
**Task Type**: {Bug Fix|Feature|Refactor|Maintenance|Investigation}

### What Was Claimed
{summary of what the issue describes}

### What We Found
{what the code actually shows}

### Root Cause
{specific root cause, with file:line references where applicable}

### Same-Behavior Check
**Behavior followed**: {the specific value, state, or decision traced from entry to final effect}
**Other relevant paths checked**:
- `{path or symbol}` — {must change, or already safe with source evidence}
**Scope result**: {additional affected files found, or "No additional affected paths"}

### Affected Files
{numbered list of files that need changes, including any added by the Same-Behavior Check}

### Evidence
{specific findings — function names, line numbers, behavior observed}

### History Findings
**Introducing commit**: {hash — author — date — subject, per primary affected file}
**Last touched**: {hash — author — date — subject}
**Pickaxe hits (prior fixes / regressions)**: {commit(s) found via \`git log -S\`/\`-G\`, or 'None found' — max 5}
{This field is MANDATORY — populate from the git blame + pickaxe commands in step 4/5. If a file is newly created (no history), write 'New file — no history.'}
**Prior Investigations (via recall)**: {Comma-separated issue citations from \`RECALL_ISSUE_CITATIONS\` (e.g. '#1172, #1243 — building on, not repeating'), or 'None — no Forge Ledger match above threshold' if \`RECALL_RESULTS\` was empty. Use the \`RECALL_ISSUE_CITATIONS\` variable populated in Phase 0.6.}

### Recommendation
{what to build/fix, concrete and actionable}

### Related Issues
{if any found via domain context discovery, max 5}

### Decomposition Assessment
**{YES|NO}** — {reason}
{if YES: proposed sub-issues with titles and dependencies}

### Acceptance Spec <!-- Added: forge#1829 -->
{For each item in the issue's ## Acceptance Criteria section, emit one machine-checkable check line using the format below. If the issue has no Acceptance Criteria section, derive checks from the Recommendation above. Each check MUST be specific, observable, and testable — not vague prose. Checks are consumed by build/validate Phase B6.5 as the merge gate.}

**Quoting (MANDATORY)**: `target=` and `matcher=` MUST always be wrapped in double quotes — `target="..."` / `matcher="..."` — even when the value is a single token (e.g. a plain file path). The downstream Phase B6.5 parser only extracts quoted values; an unquoted `target=`/`matcher=` will silently truncate at the first space and cause a false-negative gate failure for any multi-word value (shell commands with flags/arguments/pipes are almost always multi-word). Neither `target` nor `matcher` may contain a literal `"` character — use single quotes for any embedded string/regex literal inside the value, as shown below. `id=` and `type=` are always single tokens and are never quoted. `description=` is always the last field on the line and is captured to end-of-line — it does not need quoting.

```
ACCEPTANCE_CHECK: id={ac-1} type={exists|contains|command|behavior} target="{file_path|command|url}" matcher="{string|exit_0|regex}" description={one-line human description}
ACCEPTANCE_CHECK: id={ac-2} type={exists|contains|command|behavior} target="{file_path|command|url}" matcher="{string|exit_0|regex}" description={one-line human description}
```

Example with a multi-word shell command target (the case that previously broke — note the embedded single quotes around the regex, and the double quotes wrapping the whole target):
```
ACCEPTANCE_CHECK: id=ac-4 type=command target="grep -qE '(>= ?2|2\+)' commands/orchestrate/phase-1-resolve.md" matcher="exit_0" description=Fan-out cap is documented as >=2 or 2+
```

**Check types**:
- `exists` — assert a file or directory exists (`target` = path, `matcher` = ignored)
- `contains` — assert a file contains a string or regex (`target` = file path, `matcher` = string/regex)
- `command` — run a shell command and assert exit 0 (`target` = shell command, `matcher` = `exit_0`)
- `behavior` — assert a runtime/observable behavior via shell command (`target` = shell command, `matcher` = expected output string or regex)

**Self-defeating pipe guideline**: do NOT chain a `-q`/`--quiet` command into a downstream pipe consumer (e.g. `grep -q ... | grep ...`). A `-q` flag suppresses all stdout, so the next command in the pipe always receives empty input and the check can never pass regardless of the actual file content. If a check needs to verify two conditions against the same output, sequence them instead — e.g. `grep -qE 'first' file && grep -qE 'second' file` — or capture the output once and grep the captured variable.

**Skipping**: if the issue has no verifiable acceptance criteria and none can be derived from the recommendation, emit a single sentinel: `ACCEPTANCE_CHECK: id=ac-skip type=skipped target="none" matcher="none" description=No machine-checkable criteria available — human review required`
${ANNOTATION_LINK_FOOTER}
${INVESTIGATION_SENTINEL}"
```

**Do not hardcode `<!-- INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE -->` as the closing line.** The closing line MUST be the `${INVESTIGATION_SENTINEL}` variable computed above — it resolves to `<!-- INVESTIGATION:INVALID -->` for an INVALID verdict and `<!-- INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE -->` otherwise. `INVESTIGATION:COMPLETE` and `INVESTIGATION:INVALID` are mutually exclusive within a single posted comment — never emit both.

## Phase 1C.5: Create Knowledge Gist

**Skip if**: A comment containing `<!-- FORGE:KNOWLEDGE_GIST:` already exists on this issue.

After the FORGE:INVESTIGATOR comment is posted, create a structured GitHub Gist containing the investigation findings. The Gist provides a stable, linkable URL that downstream issues (siblings, children) can reference.

**This phase is non-blocking** — if Gist creation fails (auth error, rate limit, network), log the failure and continue to Phase 1D. Do NOT stall the pipeline for a knowledge artifact.

### Step 0: Check cached Gist capability

`FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE` is set once by `/orchestrate` before it dispatches workers. A standalone
`/work-on` run has no parent cache, so it performs the same read-only identity probe once for its
own process. GitHub App installation identities are `Bot` users and cannot use the Gists API.

```bash
if [ -z "${FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE+x}" ]; then
  GIST_AUTH_TYPE=$(gh api user --jq '.type' 2>/dev/null || true)
  if [ "$GIST_AUTH_TYPE" = "Bot" ]; then
    FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE=false
  else
    # Preserve the existing behavior when the identity probe is unavailable or is a PAT user.
    FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE=true
  fi
  export FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE
fi

if [ "$FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE" != "true" ]; then
  echo "INFO: Knowledge Gist subsystem unavailable for this authentication — skipping Gist phases"
  GIST_URL=""
  INDEX_URL=""
  # Skip every remaining step in Phases 1C.5 and 1C.6; continue directly to Phase 1D.
fi
```

When `FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE` is not `true`, do not call `gh gist create`, `gh gist view`,
`gh gist edit`, or any other Gist command in either Phase 1C.5 or Phase 1C.6. This is an
informational skip, not a warning, retry, or escalation.

### Step 1: Check for existing Gist annotation

```bash
EXISTING_GIST=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/{NUMBER}/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("FORGE:KNOWLEDGE_GIST:")) | .body' | head -1)

if [ -n "$EXISTING_GIST" ]; then
  echo "Knowledge Gist already exists — skipping creation"
  # → Continue to Phase 1D
fi
```

### Step 2: Extract investigation content

```bash
INVESTIGATION_BODY=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/{NUMBER}/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("FORGE:INVESTIGATOR")) | .body' | head -1)
```

### Step 3: Generate filename and metadata

```bash
ISSUE_TITLE=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json title --jq '.title')
MILESTONE=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json milestone --jq '.milestone.title // "none"')

# Generate slug from title: lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens, collapse, truncate
SLUG=$(echo "$ISSUE_TITLE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g' | sed 's/--*/-/g' | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//' | cut -c1-40)

# Derive repo short name from GH_REPO (e.g., "acme-org/acme-platform" → "acme-platform")
REPO_SHORT=$(echo "{GH_REPO}" | sed 's|.*/||')

GIST_FILENAME="${REPO_SHORT}_${NUMBER}_${SLUG}.md"
```

### Step 4: Build Gist content with frontmatter

Extract verdict, task type, and confidence from the investigation body, then compose the Gist:

```bash
VERDICT=$(echo "$INVESTIGATION_BODY" | grep -oP '(?<=\*\*Verdict\*\*: )\w+' | head -1)
TASK_TYPE=$(echo "$INVESTIGATION_BODY" | grep -oP '(?<=\*\*Task Type\*\*: ).+' | head -1)
CONFIDENCE=$(echo "$INVESTIGATION_BODY" | grep -oP '(?<=\*\*Confidence\*\*: )\w+' | head -1)
SEVERITY=$(echo "$INVESTIGATION_BODY" | grep -oP '(?<=\*\*Severity\*\*: )\w+' | head -1)
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

GIST_CONTENT=$(cat <<GIST_EOF
---
issue: ${NUMBER}
repo: {GH_REPO}
milestone: ${MILESTONE}
verdict: ${VERDICT}
task_type: ${TASK_TYPE}
confidence: ${CONFIDENCE}
severity: ${SEVERITY}
created: ${TIMESTAMP}
source: FORGE:INVESTIGATOR
---

# Investigation: ${ISSUE_TITLE} (#${NUMBER})

${INVESTIGATION_BODY}
GIST_EOF
)
```

### Step 5: Create secret Gist

```bash
GIST_URL=$(echo "$GIST_CONTENT" | gh gist create \
  -f "$GIST_FILENAME" \
  -d "Investigation findings for ${REPO_SHORT}#${NUMBER}: ${ISSUE_TITLE}" \
  - 2>/dev/null)

if [ -z "$GIST_URL" ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Gist creation failed — continuing without knowledge artifact"
  # → Continue to Phase 1D (non-blocking)
fi
```

### Step 6: Post Gist URL annotation

```bash
if [ -n "$GIST_URL" ]; then
  gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "<!-- FORGE:KNOWLEDGE_GIST: ${GIST_URL} -->
## Knowledge Gist Created

Investigation findings persisted as a linkable artifact.

**Gist**: ${GIST_URL}
**Filename**: \`${GIST_FILENAME}\`

_This Gist can be referenced by downstream issues for context transfer._"
fi
```

→ Continue to Phase 1C.6.

---

## Phase 1C.6: Update Milestone Index Gist

**Skip if**: The issue has no milestone (`MILESTONE` is `"none"` or empty).

**Also skip if**: `FORGE_GIST_CAPABLE` from Phase 1C.5 is not `true`. Do not independently
re-probe capability here; the cached result covers both Gist phases.

After the per-issue Knowledge Gist is created (Phase 1C.5), update the milestone-level index Gist. The index aggregates all investigation Gist URLs for a milestone into a single reference document. Any agent working on a milestone issue can fetch one index URL to get full context across all investigations.

**This phase is non-blocking** — if index creation or update fails, log the warning and continue to Phase 1D. Do NOT stall the pipeline for the index.

### Step 1: Check milestone and skip conditions

```bash
MILESTONE=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json milestone --jq '.milestone.title // "none"')
MILESTONE_NUM=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json milestone --jq '.milestone.number // empty')

if [ "$MILESTONE" = "none" ] || [ -z "$MILESTONE_NUM" ]; then
  echo "No milestone on issue #${NUMBER} — skipping milestone index update"
  # → Continue to Phase 1D
fi
```

### Step 2: Read milestone description for existing index

```bash
MILESTONE_DESC=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/milestones/${MILESTONE_NUM} --jq '.description // ""')
EXISTING_INDEX_URL=$(echo "$MILESTONE_DESC" | grep -oP '(?<=<!-- FORGE:MILESTONE_INDEX: )https://[^ ]+(?= -->)' | head -1)
```

### Step 3: Build index entry for this issue

```bash
ISSUE_TITLE=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json title --jq '.title')
VERDICT=$(echo "$INVESTIGATION_BODY" | grep -oP '(?<=\*\*Verdict\*\*: )\w+' | head -1)
SEVERITY=$(echo "$INVESTIGATION_BODY" | grep -oP '(?<=\*\*Severity\*\*: )\w+' | head -1)
TASK_TYPE=$(echo "$INVESTIGATION_BODY" | grep -oP '(?<=\*\*Task Type\*\*: ).+' | head -1)
RECOMMENDATION=$(echo "$INVESTIGATION_BODY" | sed -n '/^### Recommendation/,/^### /p' | head -5 | tail -n +2 | tr '\n' ' ' | cut -c1-120)

# GIST_URL comes from Phase 1C.5 (may be empty if Gist creation failed)
INDEX_ENTRY="| #${NUMBER} | ${ISSUE_TITLE} | ${VERDICT} / ${SEVERITY} | ${TASK_TYPE} | ${GIST_URL:-_no gist_} | ${RECOMMENDATION:-_see investigation_} |"
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
```

### Step 4a: Create new index Gist (no existing index)

```bash
if [ -z "$EXISTING_INDEX_URL" ]; then
  MILESTONE_SLUG=$(echo "$MILESTONE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g' | sed 's/--*/-/g' | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//' | cut -c1-40)
  REPO_SHORT=$(echo "{GH_REPO}" | sed 's|.*/||')
  INDEX_FILENAME="${REPO_SHORT}_milestone_${MILESTONE_SLUG}_index.md"

  INDEX_CONTENT=$(cat <<INDEX_EOF
---
type: milestone-index
repo: {GH_REPO}
milestone: ${MILESTONE}
milestone_number: ${MILESTONE_NUM}
last_updated: ${TIMESTAMP}
---

# Milestone Index: ${MILESTONE}

Investigation findings index for all issues in this milestone.

| Issue | Title | Verdict / Severity | Task Type | Gist URL | Key Finding |
|-------|-------|--------------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
${INDEX_ENTRY}
INDEX_EOF
)

  INDEX_URL=$(echo "$INDEX_CONTENT" | gh gist create \
    -f "$INDEX_FILENAME" \
    -d "Milestone index: ${MILESTONE} (${REPO_SHORT})" \
    - 2>/dev/null)

  if [ -z "$INDEX_URL" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Milestone index Gist creation failed — continuing without index"
    # → Continue to Phase 1D (non-blocking)
  fi
fi
```

### Step 4b: Update existing index Gist (index already exists)

```bash
if [ -n "$EXISTING_INDEX_URL" ]; then
  INDEX_GIST_ID=$(echo "$EXISTING_INDEX_URL" | grep -oP '[a-f0-9]{20,}' | tail -1)

  if [ -z "$INDEX_GIST_ID" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Could not extract Gist ID from index URL — skipping update"
    # → Continue to Phase 1D
  fi

  # Fetch current index content
  CURRENT_INDEX=$(gh gist view "$INDEX_GIST_ID" --raw 2>/dev/null)

  if [ -z "$CURRENT_INDEX" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Could not fetch existing index Gist — skipping update"
    # → Continue to Phase 1D
  fi

  # Check if this issue is already in the index
  if echo "$CURRENT_INDEX" | grep -q "| #${NUMBER} |"; then
    echo "Issue #${NUMBER} already in milestone index — skipping"
    INDEX_URL="$EXISTING_INDEX_URL"
    # → Continue to Phase 1D
  else
    # Update the last_updated timestamp in frontmatter
    UPDATED_INDEX=$(echo "$CURRENT_INDEX" | sed "s|^last_updated:.*|last_updated: ${TIMESTAMP}|")

    # Append new entry to the table
    UPDATED_INDEX="${UPDATED_INDEX}
${INDEX_ENTRY}"

    # Determine the filename from the existing Gist
    INDEX_FILENAME=$(gh api gists/${INDEX_GIST_ID} --jq '.files | keys[0]' 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -z "$INDEX_FILENAME" ]; then
      INDEX_FILENAME="milestone_index.md"
    fi

    # Update the Gist
    # gh gist edit does not support stdin via '-'; use a temp file instead
    TMPFILE=$(mktemp --suffix=.md)
    echo "$UPDATED_INDEX" > "$TMPFILE"
    gh gist edit "$INDEX_GIST_ID" -f "$INDEX_FILENAME" "$TMPFILE" 2>/dev/null
    EDIT_EXIT=$?
    rm -f "$TMPFILE"
    if [ $EDIT_EXIT -eq 0 ]; then
      INDEX_URL="$EXISTING_INDEX_URL"
      echo "Milestone index Gist updated: ${INDEX_URL}"
    else
      echo "WARNING: Failed to update milestone index Gist — continuing"
      INDEX_URL="$EXISTING_INDEX_URL"
    fi
  fi
fi
```

### Step 5: Store index URL in milestone description

```bash
if [ -n "$INDEX_URL" ]; then
  if [ -n "$EXISTING_INDEX_URL" ]; then
    # Replace existing annotation with updated URL (in case Gist was recreated)
    UPDATED_DESC=$(echo "$MILESTONE_DESC" | sed "s|<!-- FORGE:MILESTONE_INDEX: [^ ]* -->|<!-- FORGE:MILESTONE_INDEX: ${INDEX_URL} -->|")
  else
    # Append annotation to milestone description
    UPDATED_DESC="${MILESTONE_DESC}

<!-- FORGE:MILESTONE_INDEX: ${INDEX_URL} -->"
  fi

  gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/milestones/${MILESTONE_NUM} \
    -X PATCH \
    -f description="$UPDATED_DESC" 2>/dev/null

  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Milestone description updated with index URL: ${INDEX_URL}"
  else
    echo "WARNING: Failed to update milestone description — index URL not stored"
  fi
fi
```

→ Continue to Phase 1D.

## Phase 1D: Update Labels & Return Verdict

### 1D.0: Finding Lifecycle Label Transition (MANDATORY — run before workflow label update)

**Purpose**: Wire the investigation verdict into the finding-validation lifecycle. If the issue under investigation is a review-finding (carries `needs-validation`), translate the verdict into `validated` or `false-positive` using `transition-label.sh --validate`. This is the primary mechanism that resolves the `needs-validation → validated/false-positive` lifecycle gap. <!-- Added: forge#1730 -->

**Run this block regardless of verdict (CONFIRMED, PARTIAL, INVALID) — the verdict-to-label mapping handles all cases:**

```bash
# Check if this issue is a finding awaiting validation
ISSUE_LABELS=$(gh issue view {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --json labels --jq '[.labels[].name] | join(",")' 2>/dev/null || echo "")

if echo "$ISSUE_LABELS" | grep -q "needs-validation"; then
  echo "Issue #{NUMBER} has needs-validation — applying verdict label transition..."
  RESOLUTION=$(resolve_script 'transition-label')
  TIER="${RESOLUTION%%:*}"
  SCRIPT_PATH="${RESOLUTION#*:}"
  case "$TIER" in
    adaptive|universal)
      bash "$SCRIPT_PATH" --validate {VERDICT} {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} || true
      ;;
    prose)
      # Prose fallback: apply label transition directly via gh
      if [ "{VERDICT}" = "CONFIRMED" ]; then
        gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label "validated" --remove-label "needs-validation" 2>/dev/null || true
        echo "Applied: needs-validation → validated (verdict: CONFIRMED)"
      else
        gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label "false-positive" --remove-label "needs-validation" 2>/dev/null || true
        echo "Applied: needs-validation → false-positive (verdict: {VERDICT})"
      fi
      ;;
  esac
else
  echo "Issue #{NUMBER} does not have needs-validation — no finding lifecycle transition needed"
fi
```

**Verdict → label mapping**: `CONFIRMED` → `validated`; `PARTIAL`, `NOT-CONFIRMED`, `INVALID` → `false-positive`.

**Idempotency**: `transition-label.sh --validate` is a no-op if the issue already has `validated` or `false-positive`, or if it lacks `needs-validation`. Safe to call on any issue.

---

**CONFIRMED or PARTIAL with decompose: NO**:
```bash
gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label "workflow:ready-to-build" --remove-label "workflow:investigating"
```

Write machine-readable phase checkpoint (MUST execute immediately after label update, before returning):
```bash
CHECKPOINT_TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "<!-- FORGE:CHECKPOINT -->
\`\`\`json
{\"phase\": \"INVESTIGATION\", \"status\": \"COMPLETE\", \"next_phase\": \"BUILD\", \"timestamp\": \"${CHECKPOINT_TIMESTAMP}\"}
\`\`\`"
```

Return verdict to caller (work-on routing loop proceeds to build).

**CONFIRMED or PARTIAL with decompose: YES**:
```bash
gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --remove-label "workflow:investigating"
```
Do NOT add `workflow:ready-to-build` — the routing loop will invoke `work-on:decompose` based on the `decompose: YES` return value.

Write machine-readable phase checkpoint (MUST execute immediately after label update, before returning):
```bash
CHECKPOINT_TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "<!-- FORGE:CHECKPOINT -->
\`\`\`json
{\"phase\": \"INVESTIGATION\", \"status\": \"COMPLETE\", \"next_phase\": \"DECOMPOSE\", \"timestamp\": \"${CHECKPOINT_TIMESTAMP}\"}
\`\`\`"
```

Return verdict to caller (work-on routing loop proceeds to decompose).

**INVALID**:
```bash
gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label "workflow:invalid" --remove-label "workflow:investigating"
gh issue close {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --comment "Closing as invalid: {reason from investigation}"
```
Return INVALID to caller (work-on stops). No checkpoint written — INVALID is terminal.

---

## Output

The subcommand writes its results to GitHub (FORGE:INVESTIGATOR comment). Output this structured block — the routing loop in `work-on.md` will read this result, re-evaluate state, and continue to the next phase. This subcommand is complete; control returns to the router's loop iteration.

```
