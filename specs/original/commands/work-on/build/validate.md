# work-on/build/validate — Validation Subcommand

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

**Invoked by**: `work-on.md` Step 3F.5, after `implement.md` has written and staged code (not committed).
**Output**: Return `VALIDATE_RESULT` with `COMPLETE` or automated `GATED`; mechanical failures never set `needs-human`.

**Agent model policy**: `model: "{DEFAULT_MODEL}"` — resolved from forge.yaml `agents.default_model`, else "sonnet" (standard tier). Fallback: `model: "opus"` if rate-limited. Feature gate: pass `effort` in Task/Skill spawns only on Claude Code >= 2.1.154.
**NEVER use plan mode (EnterPlanMode).**

<!-- FORGE:SPEC_LOADED — work-on/build/validate.md loaded and active. Agent is bound by this spec. -->

---

## Inputs

Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
- `{NUMBER}` — issue number (required)
- `--repo {GH_REPO}` — GitHub repo (e.g. `{owner}/{repo}` — resolved from `forge.yaml → project`)
- `--gh-flag {GH_FLAG}` — gh CLI repo flag (e.g. `-R {owner}/{repo}`)
- `--worktree {WORKTREE_PATH}` — absolute path to the git worktree
- `--base-sha {FROZEN_BASE_SHA}` — exact frozen base SHA from `FORGE:BASE` (required)
- `--files {CHANGED_FILES}` — space-separated list of changed files (from implement result)

---

## No whole-phase skip

Every build reaches V5 commit and commit-evidence production. A one-file documentation or
configuration change may skip inapplicable language, browser, database, and deployment
checks inside their individual phases, but it must not return before the quality result,
exact scope gate, commit, ancestry audit, and validated commit SHA.

---

## Phase V1: Builder Self-Check — Wire-Through Proof (MANDATORY, run BEFORE quality gate loop)

<!-- Added: forge#1731 -->

Before invoking the quality gate, the builder MUST perform a self-check on newly added conditional paths. This mirrors the quality gate's 2G.8 check and allows the builder to resolve gaps before the gate invocation rather than after.

**Self-check protocol**:

1. Scan the staged diff for newly added conditional lines:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD -- {CHANGED_FILES} | grep -E '^\+' | grep -v '^+++' \
       | grep -E '\bif\b|\belif\b|\belse\b|guard|feature.?flag|FEATURE_FLAG|ENABLE_|DISABLE_'
   ```

2. For each new conditional found, confirm at least ONE of:
   - **Test in diff**: A test function or assertion in the diff exercises this conditional branch (e.g., calls the function with parameters that trigger the `if`, asserts the guarded output, or triggers the error path deliberately)
   - **WIRE:PROVEN annotation**: Add `# WIRE:PROVEN — <method>` immediately before or after the new conditional, describing how you verified it fires (e.g., `# WIRE:PROVEN — gate logic: condition is checked before every call; unreachable path would raise ValueError visible in tests`)
   - **Trivial re-guard** (auto-exempt): The conditional is a null/length/type check whose body is `return`/`continue`/`break`/`pass` or a single-line assignment — defensive re-guards with no new behavior

3. If none of the above is true for a new conditional, either:
   - Add a test or trace that exercises the path before staging
   - Add a `# WIRE:PROVEN — <method>` annotation explaining how you verified reachability
   - Confirm it qualifies as a trivial re-guard

**Why this matters**: Guards, flags, and validators that are never exercised are functionally dead code. This class has cost multiple sprint cycles in this pipeline (#1230, #1244, #1522, #1580). The self-check catches gaps before the quality gate fires, reducing iteration count. <!-- Added: forge#1731 -->

---

## Phase V1: Quality Gate Loop

**Loop protocol** — the gate MUST pass or exhaust iterations before returning:

```
iteration = 0
max_iterations = 3

while iteration < max_iterations:
    iteration += 1
    Run quality-gate agent on CHANGED_FILES
    if result == "QUALITY GATE: PASS":
        GATE_PASSED = true
        break
    else:
        # Separate quarantined test findings from real blocker findings.
        # quality-gate Step 2R classifies each failing test as PRE_BROKEN, FLAKY, or REAL.
        # TEST-QUARANTINE findings (LOW) are advisory — do not fix, do not count as gate failures.
        # TEST-REAL findings (HIGH) and all other HIGH/MEDIUM findings must be fixed.
        quarantine_findings = findings where severity == LOW and code starts with "TEST-QUARANTINE"
        blocker_findings    = findings where code != "TEST-QUARANTINE"

        if blocker_findings is empty:
            # All remaining findings are quarantined tests — gate passes from the builder's perspective.
            GATE_PASSED = true
            break
        else:
            Fix each HIGH and MEDIUM finding in blocker_findings at {WORKTREE_PATH}
            (Do NOT commit yet — fixes are staged for the next gate run)

if iteration == max_iterations AND result != PASS AND blocker_findings not empty:
    GATE_PASSED = false
    → post comment (see V1-FAIL below)
    → return VALIDATE_RESULT: status: GATED, gate_passed: false to caller, STOP
```

**Quality gate invocation**:
```
Skill("quality-gate", args="{CHANGED_FILES} --worktree {WORKTREE_PATH}")
```

**Timeout handling**: The quality-gate's executable checks carry their own explicit timeouts; a `QUALITY-GATE-TIMEOUT` result is a mechanical `GATED` outcome. Record it as HIGH, do not apply speculative fixes, post the failure evidence, and return `VALIDATE_RESULT: status: GATED, gate_passed: false` without `needs-human`. Do not retry a timed-out check. A wall-time timeout for the in-context `Skill(...)` invocation itself requires native runtime support and is not claimed by this workflow.

**Rules**:
- Re-run after EVERY fix pass — never trust that fixes resolved findings without verification
- Each iteration re-scans ALL changed files — fixes can introduce new issues
- Only HIGH and MEDIUM findings must be fixed; LOW findings are advisory only
- `TEST-QUARANTINE | LOW` findings (pre-broken or flaky tests classified by Step 2R) do **not** require fixing and do **not** count toward gate failure — include them in the V5 commit comment for reviewer visibility

**V1-FAIL comment** (post when gate never passes):
```bash
gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "## Quality Gate Failed After 3 Iterations

Quality gate findings persist after 3 fix passes. Build remains mechanically GATED.

**Files**: {CHANGED_FILES}
**Final findings**: {SUMMARY_OF_REMAINING_FINDINGS}

No commit or PR is authorized.

<!-- FORGE:GATE_FAILED -->"
```

---

## Phase V2: Format and Verify

Run after quality gate passes. All tool commands are read from `forge.yaml → verification.commands`; each step logs `SKIPPED — not configured` when the corresponding key is absent rather than silently passing.

**Track skipped checks** — initialize before any check runs:
```bash
SKIPPED_CHECKS=""

# Verification commands are project configuration; bound each one so a stalled
# formatter, typechecker, or build cannot block validation indefinitely.
# Set FORGEDOCK_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS to override the 120-second default.
run_verification_command() {
    local label="$1" command="$2"
    local timeout_seconds="${FORGEDOCK_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:-120}"
    if ! [[ "$timeout_seconds" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]*$ ]]; then
        echo "VERIFY-CONFIG | HIGH | timeout | FORGEDOCK_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS must be a positive integer (got '$timeout_seconds')"
        return 2
    fi
    timeout "$timeout_seconds" bash -c "$command" 2>&1
    local command_exit=$?
    if [ "$command_exit" -eq 124 ]; then
        echo "VERIFY-TIMEOUT | HIGH | $label | timed out after ${timeout_seconds}s"
    fi
    return "$command_exit"
}
```

**Python**:
```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}

PYTHON_FORMAT=$(yq '.verification.commands.python.format // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
if [ -n "$PYTHON_FORMAT" ]; then
    run_verification_command "python.format" "$PYTHON_FORMAT"
else
    echo "SKIPPED — python.format not configured in verification.commands"
    SKIPPED_CHECKS="${SKIPPED_CHECKS:+$SKIPPED_CHECKS, }python.format"
fi

# Compile check always runs for Python files (no config needed — catches syntax errors)
python -m py_compile {PYTHON_FILES}
```
Failures in `py_compile` are BLOCKING — fix before continuing.

**TypeScript**:
```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}

TS_FORMAT=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.format // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
TS_TYPECHECK=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.typecheck // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
TS_BUILD=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.build // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')

if [ -n "$TS_FORMAT" ]; then
    run_verification_command "typescript.format" "$TS_FORMAT"
else
    echo "SKIPPED — typescript.format not configured in verification.commands"
    SKIPPED_CHECKS="${SKIPPED_CHECKS:+$SKIPPED_CHECKS, }typescript.format"
fi

if [ -n "$TS_TYPECHECK" ]; then
    run_verification_command "typescript.typecheck" "$TS_TYPECHECK"
    TS_EXIT=$?
elif [ -n "$TS_BUILD" ]; then
    TS_OUTPUT=$(run_verification_command "typescript.build" "$TS_BUILD")
    TS_EXIT=$?
    echo "$TS_OUTPUT" | tail -30
else
    echo "SKIPPED — typescript.typecheck and typescript.build not configured in verification.commands"
    SKIPPED_CHECKS="${SKIPPED_CHECKS:+$SKIPPED_CHECKS, }typescript.typecheck/build"
    TS_EXIT=0
fi
```
Typecheck or build failures are BLOCKING — fix type errors before continuing.

**Shell scripts**: Verify service interactions — read target middleware files, document what was verified in V4 summary.

**Markdown / config files**: No format step required.

If no files match a language category, skip that language's step.

---

## Phase V3: Frontend Proxy Wiring Check

**Skip if**: No TypeScript/TSX files were changed.

Scan all changed client-side files for direct backend calls that bypass the Next.js proxy:

```bash
grep -n "api/v1" {CHANGED_TS_FILES}
grep -n "localhost:" {CHANGED_TS_FILES}
grep -n "127.0.0.1" {CHANGED_TS_FILES}
```

**Rule**: All client-side `fetch`, `useSWR`, `apiFetch`, and `axios` calls MUST use `/api/...` proxy routes. Direct calls to `/api/v1/...` or hardcoded host:port are BLOCKING.

If violations found:
1. Fix them in `{WORKTREE_PATH}`
2. Document fixes in V4 summary

---

## Phase V3.5: Database Configuration Change Advisory

**Skip if**: No changed Python files contain database engine/session/pool configuration patterns.

When changed files touch database engine configuration, flag for manual connectivity verification. Configuration bugs in `create_async_engine`, `connect_args`, or session factories are invisible to static analysis but cause immediate runtime failures.

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
DB_CONFIG_FILES=""
# Process substitution (< <(...)), NOT a piped `| while read`, so DB_CONFIG_FILES
# set inside the loop body survives past the loop (a piped while-read would run
# in a subshell and silently discard the accumulator).
while IFS= read -r f; do
    [ -z "$f" ] && continue
    grep -qE "create_async_engine|AsyncSession|connect_args|pool_size|prepared_statement|engine_from_config|sessionmaker" "$f" 2>/dev/null && \
        DB_CONFIG_FILES="${DB_CONFIG_FILES}${f}"$'\n'
done < <(echo {CHANGED_FILES} | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -E '\.py$')

if [ -n "$DB_CONFIG_FILES" ]; then
    echo "DB CONFIG CHANGE DETECTED in:"
    echo "$DB_CONFIG_FILES"
    echo "ACTION: Verify database connectivity after deploy — changes to engine config, connect_args, or session factories can cause silent runtime failures."
    echo "RECOMMENDED: Run a minimal connectivity test (e.g., SELECT 1) through the modified session/engine path."

    # Check for lambda/callable in connect_args — the exact bug class from PR #14391
    # $DB_CONFIG_FILES is one path per line (built above) — herestring, not a
    # piped `| while read`, so behavior stays consistent with the other fixes
    # in this sweep even though no accumulator is set inside this particular loop.
    while IFS= read -r f; do
        [ -z "$f" ] && continue
        grep -nE "lambda.*:.*['\"]|=lambda" "$f" 2>/dev/null | grep -iE "connect_args|prepared_statement|pool|engine" && \
            echo "WARNING: Lambda/callable in database configuration in $f — verify callback signature matches library's expected calling convention"
    done <<< "$DB_CONFIG_FILES"
fi
```

**This is advisory only** — it does not block the build. The output is included in the V5 summary to alert reviewers and deployers. This check exists because PR #14391 passed `lambda _: ""` to `prepared_statement_name_func` (which expects 0 args), breaking all worker billing. Static analysis cannot catch arity mismatches in library callbacks — the flag ensures a human verifies connectivity.

---

## Phase V3.6: Browser Signal Check

**Skip if**: No TypeScript/TSX files were changed, OR `forge.yaml → services.app_url` is absent or empty.

After static proxy checks, run a lightweight live browser check using Playwright MCP tools to surface console errors, failed network requests, and basic performance metrics for any changed UI routes. This check is advisory — findings are surfaced as warnings in the V5 summary but do NOT block the gate unless the browser session is available AND returns ERROR-level console output.

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
APP_URL=$(yq '.services.app_url // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
if [ -z "$APP_URL" ]; then
    echo "SKIPPED — services.app_url not configured in forge.yaml (browser signal check requires a running app URL)"
else
    echo "BROWSER SIGNAL CHECK: navigating $APP_URL"
fi
```

**When APP_URL is configured**, perform the following using Playwright MCP tools:

**Step 1 — Navigate**
Use `browser_navigate` to load `{APP_URL}`. If the changed files include a specific page route (e.g., `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`), derive the route path and navigate there instead (e.g., `{APP_URL}/dashboard`).

**Step 2 — Capture console messages**
```
browser_console_messages
```
Classify findings:
- Any message at `error` level → **MEDIUM** finding: `BROWSER-CONSOLE-ERROR | MEDIUM | console | {message}`
- Any message at `warn` level → **LOW** advisory: `BROWSER-CONSOLE-WARN | LOW | console | {message}`
- Ignore `info` and `log` levels

**Step 3 — Capture network failures**
```
browser_network_requests filter="static:false"
```
Check for HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses on non-static requests. Exclude known third-party analytics/tracking domains.
- HTTP 4xx or 5xx response → **HIGH** finding: `BROWSER-NETWORK-FAIL | HIGH | network | {url} returned {status}`

**Step 4 — Capture performance metrics (LCP-ish)**
```
browser_evaluate function="() => {
  const nav = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
  const paint = performance.getEntriesByType('paint');
  const fcp = paint.find(e => e.name === 'first-contentful-paint');
  return {
    domContentLoaded: nav ? Math.round(nav.domContentLoadedEventEnd) : null,
    loadTime: nav ? Math.round(nav.loadEventEnd) : null,
    fcp: fcp ? Math.round(fcp.startTime) : null
  };
}"
```
Classify:
- `loadTime > 4000` ms → **HIGH** finding: `BROWSER-PERF | HIGH | performance | page load time {loadTime}ms exceeds 4s threshold`
- `loadTime > 2500` ms → **MEDIUM** finding: `BROWSER-PERF | MEDIUM | performance | page load time {loadTime}ms exceeds 2.5s threshold`
- `fcp > 1800` ms → **LOW** advisory: `BROWSER-PERF | LOW | performance | FCP {fcp}ms — consider lazy-loading or code splitting`

**Advisory scope**: Browser signal findings are included in the V5 summary under "Browser Signals". They do NOT block the gate (GATE_PASSED stays true) unless a BROWSER-NETWORK-FAIL HIGH finding is present on the primary app URL (indicating the app is completely broken for that route). Console ERROR findings are MEDIUM — surfaced for human review, not blocking.

---

## Phase V4: Deployment Completeness Check

**Skip if**: No new environment variables were introduced in the changed files.

Detect new env vars:
```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
git diff HEAD~1 -- {CHANGED_FILES} | grep -oP '(?<=os\.environ\[")[^"]+|(?<=os\.getenv\()["\']?[A-Z_]+' | sort -u
# Also check TypeScript:
git diff HEAD~1 -- {CHANGED_FILES} | grep -oP 'process\.env\.\K[A-Z_]+' | sort -u
```

For each new env var found, verify it is present in ALL required locations:

| Location | Required for |
|----------|-------------|
| `.env.example` | All new vars |
| `infra/secrets/prod.enc.yaml` (SOPS) | Production secrets |
| `infra/decrypt-secrets.sh` ENV_MAPPING | All vars in deploy chain |
| `app/env_validation.py` | API service vars |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Vars needing explicit injection |

**Deploy chain**: SOPS → `decrypt-secrets.sh` (ENV_MAPPING) → `.env.secrets` → `merge-env-secrets.sh` → `.env.production` → docker-compose `env_file`.

If any required location is missing the var:
1. Add it to the missing location in `{WORKTREE_PATH}`
2. Document the addition in V4 summary
3. These additions are NOT new commits — they should be staged and committed together with any other pending fixes, or as a separate commit if clean

---

## Phase V4.5: Final Contract/Claim Path Gate (MANDATORY)

Validation and formatting may modify or add paths after implement.md's pre-stage check.
Immediately before V5, re-read the latest completed Builder Contract and, under
orchestration, the active claim. Enumerate every modified, deleted, renamed, staged, and
untracked non-ignored path. Every path must appear literally in the contract and, when
present, the claim. Any mismatch returns automated `GATED` before commit; do not stage or
silently absorb validation-created scope.

This is the final mutation-authority check. V5 may commit only the exact path set that
passed it.

---

## Phase V5: Commit (always — after GATE_PASSED=true)

After the gate passes, commit all staged changes in a single commit. This includes:
- The implementation changes staged by `implement.md` Phase I4
- Any format, proxy, or deploy fixes applied by phases V2–V4

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
git add -u
git commit -s -m "fix({SCOPE}): {description} (#NUMBER)"
```

Where `{SCOPE}` is the command or module scope from the contract (e.g. `work-on`, `quality-gate`), and `{description}` summarises the implementation. Use the commit convention from the contract:
- Bug Fix → `fix(`
- Feature → `feat(`
- Refactor → `refactor(`

This is the **only** commit for this build cycle. It replaces the old `git commit` that was previously in `implement.md` Phase I4. Do NOT create a separate commit for validation fixes — they are absorbed into this single commit.

**Attribution**: The commit message is exactly the conventional-commit line above — nothing more. Do NOT append a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, a `🤖 Generated with Claude Code` line, or any assistant-tool attribution. Pipeline output is ForgeDock-branded; the assistant signature must never enter the repo's commit history. (A PreToolUse guard hard-blocks it as a backstop — see `bin/hooks/pre-tool-use.mjs` Rule 5.)

### V5 Post-Commit Ancestry Audit (MANDATORY)

After committing, require exact frozen-base ancestry and detect unrelated merge commits
before the branch is pushed. Missing or invalid base evidence is `GATED`:

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
[ -n "{FROZEN_BASE_SHA}" ] || { echo "VALIDATE_RESULT: status: GATED blocker: frozen base SHA missing"; exit 1; }
git merge-base --is-ancestor "{FROZEN_BASE_SHA}" HEAD || {
  echo "VALIDATE_RESULT: status: GATED blocker: HEAD is not descended from frozen base"
  exit 1
}
MERGE_COMMITS=$(git log --merges HEAD ^"{FROZEN_BASE_SHA}" 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$MERGE_COMMITS" ]; then
  echo "ANCESTRY AUDIT FAILED: merge commits from unrelated branches detected on this branch:"
  echo "$MERGE_COMMITS"
  # Block push — do NOT proceed to review.md R1
  gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "## Ancestry Audit Failed

Branch \`{BRANCH}\` contains merge commits from branches outside the PR base (\`{PR_BASE}\`). This is a staging contamination risk — these commits may carry code from milestone branches that has not been approved for \`{PR_BASE}\`.

**Detected merge commits**:
\`\`\`
${MERGE_COMMITS}
\`\`\`

Build remains mechanically GATED; no push or PR is authorized.

<!-- FORGE:ANCESTRY_FAILED -->"
  echo "VALIDATE_RESULT: status: GATED gate_passed: false blocker: ancestry audit failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

### V5 Post-Commit: Return Commit Evidence (MANDATORY)

After the ancestry audit passes (or is skipped), return the exact clean commit SHA to the
calling build phase. Do **not** append `<!-- FORGE:BUILDER:COMPLETE -->` here: the build is
not complete until Phase B6.5 executes every acceptance check. The caller appends the
completion marker only after acceptance passes and binds it to this commit.

```bash
VALIDATED_COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
[ -z "$(git status --porcelain)" ] || {
  echo "VALIDATE-COMMIT | HIGH | worktree | validation left uncommitted changes"
  exit 1
}
echo "VALIDATED_COMMIT_SHA=$VALIDATED_COMMIT_SHA"
```

A crash after commit but before acceptance leaves the partial `FORGE:BUILDER` comment
without `:COMPLETE`; resume must rerun acceptance rather than treating the build as done.

---

## Output

Return structured output to the caller:

```
VALIDATE_RESULT:
  status: COMPLETE | GATED
  gate_passed: true | false
  validated_commit_sha: {exact SHA from V5; required when status=COMPLETE}
  quality_gate_iterations: {COUNT}
  format_issues_fixed: {COUNT}
  proxy_violations_fixed: {COUNT}
  deploy_completeness_fixes: [{VAR_NAME: location_added}, ...]
  commits_added: [{SHA}, ...]  # from V5 if any
  blocker: {description if gate_passed=false}
  verification_skipped: []  # empty when all configured checks ran; list of skipped check names otherwise
                            # e.g. ["python.format", "typescript.typecheck/build"]
                            # populated from SKIPPED_CHECKS in Phase V2
```

---

## Integration Point in work-on.md

This module runs at **Step 3F.5** — after implement, before commit (3J) and PR creation (Phase 4):

```
3F  → Implement (by implement.md) — code written, staged (not committed)
3F.5 → [THIS MODULE] Validate — gate loop, format, proxy, browser signals, deploy checks
3G  → (covered by Phase V2 above)
3H  → (covered by Phase V3 above)
3H.5 → (covered by Phase V3.6 above — browser signal check for UI changes)
3I  → (covered by Phase V4 above)
3J  → V5 commit happens here after GATE_PASSED=true (single commit for implementation + any fixes)
```

If `VALIDATE_RESULT: gate_passed: false`, the router preserves automated `GATED` evidence and stops — no PR is created and no `needs-human` label is added.
