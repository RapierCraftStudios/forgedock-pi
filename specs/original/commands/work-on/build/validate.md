# work-on/build/validate — Validation Subcommand

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

**Invoked by**: `work-on.md` Step 3F.5, after `implement.md` has written and staged code (not committed).
**Output**: Return `GATE_PASSED: true/false` to caller. On failure after max iterations, post comment and set `needs-human`.

**Agent model policy**: `model: "{DEFAULT_MODEL}"` — resolved from forge.yaml `agents.default_model`, else "sonnet" (standard tier). Fallback: `model: "opus"` if rate-limited. Feature gate: pass `effort` in Task/Skill spawns only on Claude Code >= 2.1.154.
**NEVER use plan mode (EnterPlanMode).**

<!-- FORGE:SPEC_LOADED — work-on/build/validate.md loaded and active. Agent is bound by this spec. -->

---

## Inputs

Parse from $ARGUMENTS:
- `{NUMBER}` — issue number (required)
- `--repo {GH_REPO}` — GitHub repo (e.g. `{owner}/{repo}` — resolved from `forge.yaml → project`)
- `--gh-flag {GH_FLAG}` — gh CLI repo flag (e.g. `-R {owner}/{repo}`)
- `--worktree {WORKTREE_PATH}` — absolute path to the git worktree
- `--files {CHANGED_FILES}` — space-separated list of changed files (from implement result)

---

## Skip Conditions

Skip all phases (return `GATE_PASSED: true` immediately) if:
- Only 1 file was changed AND it is a config or docs file with no code logic (e.g. `.md`, `.yml` with no scripts, `.env.example`)

In all other cases, the gate MUST run.

---

## Phase V1: Builder Self-Check — Wire-Through Proof (MANDATORY, run BEFORE quality gate loop)

<!-- Added: forge#1731 -->

Before invoking the quality gate, the builder MUST perform a self-check on newly added conditional paths. This mirrors the quality gate's 2G.8 check and allows the builder to resolve gaps before the gate invocation rather than after.

**Self-check protocol**:

1. Scan the staged diff for newly added conditional lines:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD -- {CHANGED_FILES} | grep -E '^\+' | grep -v '^+++' \
       | grep -E '\bif\b|\belif\b|\belse\b|guard|feature.?flag|FEATURE_FLAG|ENABLE_|DISABLE_'
   ```

2. For each new conditional found, confirm at least ONE of:
   - **Test in diff**: A test function or assertion in the diff exercises this conditional branch (e.g., calls the function with parameters that trigger the `if`, asserts the guarded output, or triggers the error path deliberately)
   - **WIRE:PROVEN annotation**: Add `# WIRE:PROVEN — <method>` immediately before or after the new conditional, describing how you verified it fires (e.g., `# WIRE:PROVEN — gate logic: condition is checked before every call; unreachable path would raise ValueError visible in tests`)
   - **Trivial re-guard** (auto-exempt): The conditional is a null/length/type check whose body is `return`/`continue`/`break`/`pass` or a single-line assignment — defensive re-guards with no new behavior

3. If none of the above is true for a new conditional, either:
   - Add a test or trace that exercises the path before staging
   - Add a `# WIRE:PROVEN — <method>` annotation explaining how you verified reachability
   - Confirm it qualifies as a trivial re-guard

**Why this matters**: Guards, flags, and validators that are never exercised are functionally dead code. This class has cost multiple sprint cycles in this pipeline (#1230, #1244, #1522, #1580). The self-check catches gaps before the quality gate fires, reducing iteration count. <!-- Added: forge#1731 -->

---

## Phase V1: Quality Gate Loop

**Loop protocol** — the gate MUST pass or exhaust iterations before returning:

```
iteration = 0
max_iterations = 3

while iteration < max_iterations:
    iteration += 1
    Run quality-gate agent on CHANGED_FILES
    if result == "QUALITY GATE: PASS":
        GATE_PASSED = true
        break
    else:
        # Separate quarantined test findings from real blocker findings.
        # quality-gate Step 2R classifies each failing test as PRE_BROKEN, FLAKY, or REAL.
        # TEST-QUARANTINE findings (LOW) are advisory — do not fix, do not count as gate failures.
        # TEST-REAL findings (HIGH) and all other HIGH/MEDIUM findings must be fixed.
        quarantine_findings = findings where severity == LOW and code starts with "TEST-QUARANTINE"
        blocker_findings    = findings where code != "TEST-QUARANTINE"

        if blocker_findings is empty:
            # All remaining findings are quarantined tests — gate passes from the builder's perspective.
            GATE_PASSED = true
            break
        else:
            Fix each HIGH and MEDIUM finding in blocker_findings at {WORKTREE_PATH}
            (Do NOT commit yet — fixes are staged for the next gate run)

if iteration == max_iterations AND result != PASS AND blocker_findings not empty:
    GATE_PASSED = false
    → post comment (see V1-FAIL below)
    → add label needs-human
    → return GATE_PASSED: false to caller, STOP
```

**Quality gate invocation**:
```
Skill("quality-gate", args="{CHANGED_FILES} --worktree {WORKTREE_PATH}")
```

**Timeout handling**: The quality-gate's executable checks carry their own explicit timeouts; a `QUALITY-GATE-TIMEOUT` result is a failed gate iteration. Record it as HIGH, do not apply speculative fixes, and proceed to V1-FAIL immediately (post the failure comment, add `needs-human`, return `GATE_PASSED: false`). Do not retry a timed-out check. A wall-time timeout for the in-context `Skill(...)` invocation itself requires native runtime support and is not claimed by this workflow.

**Rules**:
- Re-run after EVERY fix pass — never trust that fixes resolved findings without verification
- Each iteration re-scans ALL changed files — fixes can introduce new issues
- Only HIGH and MEDIUM findings must be fixed; LOW findings are advisory only
- `TEST-QUARANTINE | LOW` findings (pre-broken or flaky tests classified by Step 2R) do **not** require fixing and do **not** count toward gate failure — include them in the V5 commit comment for reviewer visibility

**V1-FAIL comment** (post when gate never passes):
```bash
gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "## Quality Gate Failed After 3 Iterations

Quality gate findings persist after 3 fix passes. Flagging for human review.

**Files**: {CHANGED_FILES}
**Final findings**: {SUMMARY_OF_REMAINING_FINDINGS}

Needs human review before proceeding to commit.

<!-- FORGE:GATE_FAILED -->"
```

---

## Phase V2: Format and Verify

Run after quality gate passes. All tool commands are read from `forge.yaml → verification.commands`; each step logs `SKIPPED — not configured` when the corresponding key is absent rather than silently passing.

**Track skipped checks** — initialize before any check runs:
```bash
SKIPPED_CHECKS=""

# Verification commands are project configuration; bound each one so a stalled
# formatter, typechecker, or build cannot block validation indefinitely.
# Set FORGEDOCK_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS to override the 120-second default.
run_verification_command() {
    local label="$1" command="$2"
    local timeout_seconds="${FORGEDOCK_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:-120}"
    if ! [[ "$timeout_seconds" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]*$ ]]; then
        echo "VERIFY-CONFIG | HIGH | timeout | FORGEDOCK_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS must be a positive integer (got '$timeout_seconds')"
        return 2
    fi
    timeout "$timeout_seconds" bash -c "$command" 2>&1
    local command_exit=$?
    if [ "$command_exit" -eq 124 ]; then
        echo "VERIFY-TIMEOUT | HIGH | $label | timed out after ${timeout_seconds}s"
    fi
    return "$command_exit"
}
```

**Python**:
```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}

PYTHON_FORMAT=$(yq '.verification.commands.python.format // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
if [ -n "$PYTHON_FORMAT" ]; then
    run_verification_command "python.format" "$PYTHON_FORMAT"
else
    echo "SKIPPED — python.format not configured in verification.commands"
    SKIPPED_CHECKS="${SKIPPED_CHECKS:+$SKIPPED_CHECKS, }python.format"
fi

# Compile check always runs for Python files (no config needed — catches syntax errors)
python -m py_compile {PYTHON_FILES}
```
Failures in `py_compile` are BLOCKING — fix before continuing.

**Environment-aware dependency diagnostics**:

When a dependency-backed formatter, linter, or type checker reports unresolved third-party imports, parse those diagnostics separately from syntax and changed-code errors using the deterministic `src/core/verification-diagnostics.ts` classifier. Read `verification.environment` from `forge.yaml`; its `fallbackCommands` entries must name commands already present in `verification.commands`. Run configured container/venv fallbacks through the approved named-command path before classifying the host result.

- A passing configured container/venv fallback marks only the unresolved host dependency diagnostics `environment-only`.
- Syntax errors, changed-code type errors, unknown non-empty failures, and diagnostics reproduced by the fallback remain blocking.
- Never install dependencies, add suppressions, or edit analysis configuration as part of validation.
- If no fallback is configured or provisioned, retain the block and emit one machine-readable skipped record for each unavailable check. Render each as exactly `SKIPPED — environment not provisioned (environment: {name}; attempted command: {command})`.
- Persist the structured report, including diagnostic kind, environment name, attempted command, fallback status, and outcome, in the verification result so review and resumed work-on runs do not ask for the same decision again.

**TypeScript**:
```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}

TS_FORMAT=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.format // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
TS_TYPECHECK=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.typecheck // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
TS_BUILD=$(yq '.verification.commands.typescript.build // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')

if [ -n "$TS_FORMAT" ]; then
    run_verification_command "typescript.format" "$TS_FORMAT"
else
    echo "SKIPPED — typescript.format not configured in verification.commands"
    SKIPPED_CHECKS="${SKIPPED_CHECKS:+$SKIPPED_CHECKS, }typescript.format"
fi

if [ -n "$TS_TYPECHECK" ]; then
    run_verification_command "typescript.typecheck" "$TS_TYPECHECK"
    TS_EXIT=$?
elif [ -n "$TS_BUILD" ]; then
    TS_OUTPUT=$(run_verification_command "typescript.build" "$TS_BUILD")
    TS_EXIT=$?
    echo "$TS_OUTPUT" | tail -30
else
    echo "SKIPPED — typescript.typecheck and typescript.build not configured in verification.commands"
    SKIPPED_CHECKS="${SKIPPED_CHECKS:+$SKIPPED_CHECKS, }typescript.typecheck/build"
    TS_EXIT=0
fi
```
Typecheck or build failures are BLOCKING — fix type errors before continuing.

**Shell scripts**: Verify service interactions — read target middleware files, document what was verified in V4 summary.

**Markdown / config files**: No format step required.

If no files match a language category, skip that language's step.

---

## Phase V3: Frontend Proxy Wiring Check

**Skip if**: No TypeScript/TSX files were changed.

Scan all changed client-side files for direct backend calls that bypass the Next.js proxy:

```bash
grep -n "api/v1" {CHANGED_TS_FILES}
grep -n "localhost:" {CHANGED_TS_FILES}
grep -n "127.0.0.1" {CHANGED_TS_FILES}
```

**Rule**: All client-side `fetch`, `useSWR`, `apiFetch`, and `axios` calls MUST use `/api/...` proxy routes. Direct calls to `/api/v1/...` or hardcoded host:port are BLOCKING.

If violations found:
1. Fix them in `{WORKTREE_PATH}`
2. Document fixes in V4 summary

---

## Phase V3.5: Database Configuration Change Advisory

**Skip if**: No changed Python files contain database engine/session/pool configuration patterns.

When changed files touch database engine configuration, flag for manual connectivity verification. Configuration bugs in `create_async_engine`, `connect_args`, or session factories are invisible to static analysis but cause immediate runtime failures.

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
DB_CONFIG_FILES=""
# Process substitution (< <(...)), NOT a piped `| while read`, so DB_CONFIG_FILES
# set inside the loop body survives past the loop (a piped while-read would run
# in a subshell and silently discard the accumulator).
while IFS= read -r f; do
    [ -z "$f" ] && continue
    grep -qE "create_async_engine|AsyncSession|connect_args|pool_size|prepared_statement|engine_from_config|sessionmaker" "$f" 2>/dev/null && \
        DB_CONFIG_FILES="${DB_CONFIG_FILES}${f}"$'\n'
done < <(echo {CHANGED_FILES} | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -E '\.py$')

if [ -n "$DB_CONFIG_FILES" ]; then
    echo "DB CONFIG CHANGE DETECTED in:"
    echo "$DB_CONFIG_FILES"
    echo "ACTION: Verify database connectivity after deploy — changes to engine config, connect_args, or session factories can cause silent runtime failures."
    echo "RECOMMENDED: Run a minimal connectivity test (e.g., SELECT 1) through the modified session/engine path."

    # Check for lambda/callable in connect_args — the exact bug class from PR #14391
    # $DB_CONFIG_FILES is one path per line (built above) — herestring, not a
    # piped `| while read`, so behavior stays consistent with the other fixes
    # in this sweep even though no accumulator is set inside this particular loop.
    while IFS= read -r f; do
        [ -z "$f" ] && continue
        grep -nE "lambda.*:.*['\"]|=lambda" "$f" 2>/dev/null | grep -iE "connect_args|prepared_statement|pool|engine" && \
            echo "WARNING: Lambda/callable in database configuration in $f — verify callback signature matches library's expected calling convention"
    done <<< "$DB_CONFIG_FILES"
fi
```

**This is advisory only** — it does not block the build. The output is included in the V5 summary to alert reviewers and deployers. This check exists because PR #14391 passed `lambda _: ""` to `prepared_statement_name_func` (which expects 0 args), breaking all worker billing. Static analysis cannot catch arity mismatches in library callbacks — the flag ensures a human verifies connectivity.

---

## Phase V3.6: Browser Signal Check

**Skip if**: No TypeScript/TSX files were changed, OR `forge.yaml → services.app_url` is absent or empty.

After static proxy checks, run a lightweight live browser check using Playwright MCP tools to surface console errors, failed network requests, and basic performance metrics for any changed UI routes. This check is advisory — findings are surfaced as warnings in the V5 summary but do NOT block the gate unless the browser session is available AND returns ERROR-level console output.

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
APP_URL=$(yq '.services.app_url // ""' forge.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo '')
if [ -z "$APP_URL" ]; then
    echo "SKIPPED — services.app_url not configured in forge.yaml (browser signal check requires a running app URL)"
else
    echo "BROWSER SIGNAL CHECK: navigating $APP_URL"
fi
```

**When APP_URL is configured**, perform the following using Playwright MCP tools:

**Step 1 — Navigate**
Use `browser_navigate` to load `{APP_URL}`. If the changed files include a specific page route (e.g., `web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`), derive the route path and navigate there instead (e.g., `{APP_URL}/dashboard`).

**Step 2 — Capture console messages**
```
browser_console_messages
```
Classify findings:
- Any message at `error` level → **MEDIUM** finding: `BROWSER-CONSOLE-ERROR | MEDIUM | console | {message}`
- Any message at `warn` level → **LOW** advisory: `BROWSER-CONSOLE-WARN | LOW | console | {message}`
- Ignore `info` and `log` levels

**Step 3 — Capture network failures**
```
browser_network_requests filter="static:false"
```
Check for HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses on non-static requests. Exclude known third-party analytics/tracking domains.
- HTTP 4xx or 5xx response → **HIGH** finding: `BROWSER-NETWORK-FAIL | HIGH | network | {url} returned {status}`

**Step 4 — Capture performance metrics (LCP-ish)**
```
browser_evaluate function="() => {
  const nav = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
  const paint = performance.getEntriesByType('paint');
  const fcp = paint.find(e => e.name === 'first-contentful-paint');
  return {
    domContentLoaded: nav ? Math.round(nav.domContentLoadedEventEnd) : null,
    loadTime: nav ? Math.round(nav.loadEventEnd) : null,
    fcp: fcp ? Math.round(fcp.startTime) : null
  };
}"
```
Classify:
- `loadTime > 4000` ms → **HIGH** finding: `BROWSER-PERF | HIGH | performance | page load time {loadTime}ms exceeds 4s threshold`
- `loadTime > 2500` ms → **MEDIUM** finding: `BROWSER-PERF | MEDIUM | performance | page load time {loadTime}ms exceeds 2.5s threshold`
- `fcp > 1800` ms → **LOW** advisory: `BROWSER-PERF | LOW | performance | FCP {fcp}ms — consider lazy-loading or code splitting`

**Advisory scope**: Browser signal findings are included in the V5 summary under "Browser Signals". They do NOT block the gate (GATE_PASSED stays true) unless a BROWSER-NETWORK-FAIL HIGH finding is present on the primary app URL (indicating the app is completely broken for that route). Console ERROR findings are MEDIUM — surfaced for human review, not blocking.

---

## Phase V4: Deployment Completeness Check

**Skip if**: No new environment variables were introduced in the changed files.

Detect new env vars:
```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
git diff HEAD~1 -- {CHANGED_FILES} | grep -oP '(?<=os\.environ\[")[^"]+|(?<=os\.getenv\()["\']?[A-Z_]+' | sort -u
# Also check TypeScript:
git diff HEAD~1 -- {CHANGED_FILES} | grep -oP 'process\.env\.\K[A-Z_]+' | sort -u
```

For each new env var found, verify it is present in ALL required locations:

| Location | Required for |
|----------|-------------|
| `.env.example` | All new vars |
| `infra/secrets/prod.enc.yaml` (SOPS) | Production secrets |
| `infra/decrypt-secrets.sh` ENV_MAPPING | All vars in deploy chain |
| `app/env_validation.py` | API service vars |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Vars needing explicit injection |

**Deploy chain**: SOPS → `decrypt-secrets.sh` (ENV_MAPPING) → `.env.secrets` → `merge-env-secrets.sh` → `.env.production` → docker-compose `env_file`.

If any required location is missing the var:
1. Add it to the missing location in `{WORKTREE_PATH}`
2. Document the addition in V4 summary
3. These additions are NOT new commits — they should be staged and committed together with any other pending fixes, or as a separate commit if clean

---

## Phase V5: Commit (always — after GATE_PASSED=true)

After the gate passes, commit all staged changes in a single commit. This includes:
- The implementation changes staged by `implement.md` Phase I4
- Any format, proxy, or deploy fixes applied by phases V2–V4

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
git add -u
git commit -s -m "fix({SCOPE}): {description} (#NUMBER)"
```

Where `{SCOPE}` is the command or module scope from the contract (e.g. `work-on`, `quality-gate`), and `{description}` summarises the implementation. Use the commit convention from the contract:
- Bug Fix → `fix(`
- Feature → `feat(`
- Refactor → `refactor(`

This is the **only** commit for this build cycle. It replaces the old `git commit` that was previously in `implement.md` Phase I4. Do NOT create a separate commit for validation fixes — they are absorbed into this single commit.

**Attribution**: The commit message is exactly the conventional-commit line above — nothing more. Do NOT append a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, a `🤖 Generated with Claude Code` line, or any assistant-tool attribution. Pipeline output is ForgeDock-branded; the assistant signature must never enter the repo's commit history. (A PreToolUse guard hard-blocks it as a backstop — see `bin/hooks/pre-tool-use.mjs` Rule 5.)

### V5 Post-Commit Ancestry Audit (MANDATORY)

After committing, run the ancestry audit to detect merge commits from unrelated branches before the branch is pushed:

```bash
cd {WORKTREE_PATH}
MERGE_COMMITS=$(git log --merges HEAD ^origin/{PR_BASE} 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$MERGE_COMMITS" ]; then
  echo "ANCESTRY AUDIT FAILED: merge commits from unrelated branches detected on this branch:"
  echo "$MERGE_COMMITS"
  # Block push — do NOT proceed to review.md R1
  gh issue comment {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --body "## Ancestry Audit Failed

Branch \`{BRANCH}\` contains merge commits from branches outside the PR base (\`{PR_BASE}\`). This is a staging contamination risk — these commits may carry code from milestone branches that has not been approved for \`{PR_BASE}\`.

**Detected merge commits**:
\`\`\`
${MERGE_COMMITS}
\`\`\`

Human review required before this branch can be pushed.

<!-- FORGE:ANCESTRY_FAILED -->"
  gh issue edit {NUMBER} {GH_FLAG} --add-label "needs-human"
  # Return GATE_PASSED: false — do not push
  exit 1
fi
```

If `origin/{PR_BASE}` does not exist yet (new branch), skip this check — no contamination is possible from a non-existent base. Detect with:
```bash
git ls-remote --exit-code origin {PR_BASE} >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "PR_BASE not on origin — skipping ancestry audit"
```

### V5 Post-Commit: Mark Build Complete (MANDATORY)

After the ancestry audit passes (or is skipped), append `<!-- FORGE:BUILDER:COMPLETE -->` to the existing FORGE:BUILDER comment. This is the **only** place this marker is written — it signals that a real commit exists on the branch and the build is safe to resume-skip. <!-- Added: forge#1305 -->

```bash
# Find the FORGE:BUILDER comment posted by implement.md Phase I6
BUILDER_COMMENT_ID=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/{NUMBER}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.body | contains("FORGE:BUILDER") and (contains("FORGE:BUILDER:COMPLETE") | not))] | last | .id // ""')

if [ -n "$BUILDER_COMMENT_ID" ]; then
  # Fetch current body and append the completion marker plus best-effort cost signal
  CURRENT_BODY=$(gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/comments/$BUILDER_COMMENT_ID --jq '.body')
  # Best-effort cost append: only include if session telemetry provides a value; never block
  PHASE_COST_LINE=""
  [ -n "${PHASE_COST_USD:-}" ] && PHASE_COST_LINE="
cost_usd: ${PHASE_COST_USD}"
  UPDATED_BODY="${CURRENT_BODY}${PHASE_COST_LINE}

<!-- FORGE:BUILDER:COMPLETE -->"
  gh api repos/{GH_REPO}/issues/comments/$BUILDER_COMMENT_ID \
    -X PATCH \
    --field body="$UPDATED_BODY"
  echo "FORGE:BUILDER:COMPLETE appended to comment $BUILDER_COMMENT_ID"
else
  echo "WARNING: FORGE:BUILDER comment not found or already marked complete — skipping BUILDER:COMPLETE append"
fi
```

**Why here and not in implement.md**: The commit (`git commit`) runs in this phase (V5). Appending `:COMPLETE` after the commit ensures that a session crash between implement.md I6 (comment posted) and this step (commit) leaves a partial BUILDER comment without `:COMPLETE`. The next resume will detect the partial comment, delete it, and restart the build. See `implement.md § Phase I1 resume check`.

## Integration Point in work-on.md

This module runs at **Step 3F.5** — after implement, before commit (3J) and PR creation (Phase 4):

```
3F  → Implement (by implement.md) — code written, staged (not committed)
3F.5 → [THIS MODULE] Validate — gate loop, format, proxy, browser signals, deploy checks
3G  → (covered by Phase V2 above)
3H  → (covered by Phase V3 above)
3H.5 → (covered by Phase V3.6 above — browser signal check for UI changes)
3I  → (covered by Phase V4 above)
3J  → V5 commit happens here after GATE_PASSED=true (single commit for implementation + any fixes)
```

If `VALIDATE_RESULT: gate_passed: false`, the router adds `needs-human` label and stops — no PR is created.
