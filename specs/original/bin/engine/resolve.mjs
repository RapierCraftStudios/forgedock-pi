/**
 * Issue-set resolution predicate model — standing-query re-resolution (forge#2236).
 *
 * `/orchestrate`'s Phase 1 (`commands/orchestrate/phase-1-resolve.md`) turns
 * `$ARGUMENTS` into a concrete list of issue numbers exactly once, at T0, and
 * that list is frozen for the rest of the run (`commands/orchestrate/phase-4-execution.md`
 * states this plainly: "Phase 1 only runs once, at the start."). Of the 8
 * input patterns Phase 1 accepts, only one (`#1 #2 #3` — an explicit literal
 * set) is actually a one-time snapshot by nature. The other 7
 * (`milestone <slug>`, `next <N>`, `next <N> all-repos`, `fast-lane`,
 * `priority:P0`/`priority:P1`/..., `mcp:fast`/`n8n:next 3`, a bare `<slug>`)
 * are standing queries/predicates — "work all P0s", "work this milestone" —
 * and a new issue matching that predicate mid-run is currently invisible to
 * the DAG until the operator re-invokes `/orchestrate` by hand.
 *
 * This module is the typed reference implementation for two decisions Phase 1
 * and Phase 4 need to make about that gap:
 *
 *   1. `classifyInputPattern` — is this input a `literal` set (never
 *      re-resolve — the list of numbers IS the intent) or a `query`
 *      (re-resolve periodically — the predicate is the intent)?
 *   2. `shouldReResolve` — given that classification and the run's
 *      `orchestration.reresolve` config, should Phase 4's Step 4B loop
 *      actually re-run the query this round?
 *   3. `foldNewMatches` — of the issue numbers a re-resolution just
 *      returned, which ones are genuinely new (not already in this run's
 *      processed-issue registry) and therefore candidates to fold into the
 *      live DAG?
 *
 * As with `bin/engine/admission.mjs` (forge#2234), this module does not
 * itself shell out to `gh`/`yq` — the orchestrator is LLM-executed prose,
 * not a `bin/engine/` call site, so `commands/orchestrate/phase-1-resolve.md`
 * and `commands/orchestrate/phase-4-execution.md` mirror these rules by hand
 * in bash. Any change to the classification table or defaults here MUST be
 * mirrored there too (see forge#1837 — mirrored-logic drift between grep ERE
 * and a typed reference is a recurring review-finding class in this pair of
 * files).
 *
 * Hard invariant (by design, not configurable): `foldNewMatches` only ever
 * narrows a re-resolved set down to "not yet processed" — it does not itself
 * decide admission. Every folded-in issue (`newMatches`) MUST still be
 * dispatched through the exact same path a T0-resolved issue takes —
 * standard DAG dependency analysis (`phase-3-dependency.md`) followed by
 * Step 4A/4B's `dispatch_headroom`-gated dispatch (see
 * `phase-4-execution.md` Step 4B.6) — before an agent is dispatched on it.
 * This is deliberately **not** Step 4C's `admission.mjs`'s
 * `evaluateCascadeFinding` chain: that gate's rules (comment/typo keyword
 * heuristic, P3+same-file defer, generation cap) are shaped for
 * cascade-spawned review-findings — a different issue-origin stream — and
 * would incorrectly restrict legitimate re-resolved standing-query issues
 * if applied here. A mid-run check that detects new work but never
 * actually wires into dispatch is exactly the dead-code failure class
 * documented in forge#1832 (`SURFACE_BATCHED_FINDINGS`) — this module must
 * not become a second instance of it.

 *   slicing off a leading keyword token — for those two patterns the
